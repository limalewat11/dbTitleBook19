While helping students to develop their problem-solving skills, the author motivates students with practical applications from various areas of ECE that demonstrate the relevance of probability theory to engineering practice. Included are chapter overviews, summaries, checklists of important terms, annotated references, and a wide selection of fully worked-out real-world examples. In this edition, the Computer Methods sections have been updated and substantially enhanced and new problems have been added.</p><p><p> Probability and Random Processes for Electrical Engineering presents a carefully motivated, accessible, and interesting introduction to probability and random processes. It is designed to allow the instructor maximum flexibility in the selection of topics. In addition to the standard topics taught in introductory courses on probability, random variables, and random processes, the book includes sections on modeling, basic statistical techniques, computer simulation, reliability, and entropy, as well as concise but relatively complete introductions to Markov chains and queueing theory. </p><p>The complexity of the systems encountered in electrical and computer engineering calls for an understanding of probability concepts and a facility in the use of probability tools from an increasing number of B.S. degree graduates. The introductory Course should therefore teach the student not only the basic theoretical concepts but also how to solve problems that arise in engineering practice. This course requires that the student develop problem-solving skills and understand how to make the transition from a real problem to a probability model for that problem. Relevance to Engineering Practice </p><p>Motivating students is a major challenge in introductory probability courses. Instructors need to respond by showing students the relevance of probability theory to engineering practice. Chapter 1 addresses this challenge by discussing the role of probability models in engineering design. Practical applications from various areas of electrical and computer engineering are used to show how averages and relative frequencies provide the proper tools for handling the design of systems that involve randomness. These application areas are used in examples and problems throughout the text. From Problems to Probability Models </p><p>The transition from real problems to probability models is shown in several ways. First, important concepts are usually developed by presenting real data or computer-simulated data. Second, sections on basic statistical techniques are integrated throughout the text. These sections demonstrate how statistical methods provide the link between theory and the real world. Finally, the significant random variables and random processes are developed using model-building arguments that range from simple to complex. For example, in Chapter 2 and 3, text discussion proceeds from coin tossing to Bernoulli trials. It then continues to the binomial and geometric distributions, and finally proceeds via limiting arguments to the Poisson, exponential, and Gaussian distributions. Examples and Problems </p><p>Numerous examples in every section are used to demonstrate analytical and problem-solving techniques, develop concepts using simplified cases, and illustrate applications. The text includes over 700 problems, identified by section to help the instructor select homework problems. Additional sets of problems requiring cumulative knowledge are provided at the end of each chapter. Answers to selected problems are included at the end of the text. A Student Solutions Manual accompanies this text to develop problem-solving skills. A sampling of 25% of carefully worked out problems has been selected to help students understand concepts presented in the text. An Instructors Solutions Manual with complete solutions is also available. Computer Methods </p><p>The development of an intuition for randomness can be aided by the use of computer exercises. Appendix C contains computer programs for generating several well-known random variables. The resulting data from computer-generated random numbers and variables can be analyzed using the statistical methods introduced in the text. </p><p>Sections on computer methods have been integrated into the text rather than isolated in a separate chapter because performing the computer exercises during lessons helps students to learn basic probability concepts. It should be noted that the computer methods introduced in Sections 2.7, 3.11, and 4.10 do not necessarily require entirely new lectures. The transformation method in Section 3.11 can be incorporated into the discussion on functions of a random variable. Similarly, the material in Section 4.10 can be incorporated into the discussion on transformations of random vectors. Random Variables and Continuous-Time Random Processes </p><p>Discrete-time random processes provide a crucial "bridge" in going from random variables to continuous-time random processes. Care is taken in the first five chapters to lay the proper groundwork for this transition. Thus sequences of dependent experiments are discussed in Chapter 2 as a preview of Markov chains. In Chapter 4, emphasis is placed on how a joint distribution generates a consistent family of marginal distributions. Chapter 5 introduces sequences of independent identically distributed (iid) random variables. Chapter 6 considers the sum of an iid sequence to produce important examples of random processes. Throughout Chapters 6 and 7, a concise development of the concepts is achieved by developing discrete-time and continuous-time results in parallel. Markov Chains and Queueing Theory </p><p>Markov chains and queueing theory have become essential tools in communication network and computer system modeling. In the introductory course on probability only a few changes need to be made to accommodate these new requirements. The treatment of conditional probability and conditional expectation needs to be modified, and the Poisson and gamma random variables need to be given greater prominence. In an introductory course on random processes a new balance needs to be struck between the traditional discussion of wide-sense stationary processes and linear systems and the discussion of Markov chains and queueing theory. The "optimum" balance between these two needs will surely vary from instructor to instructor, so the text includes more material than can be covered in one semester in order to give the instructor leeway to strike a balance. Suggested Syllabi </p><p>The first five chapters form the basis of a one-semester introduction to probability. In addition to the optional sections on computer methods, these chapters also include optional sections on combinatorics, reliability, confidence intervals, and basic results from renewal theory. In a one-semester course, it is possible to provide an introduction to random processes by omitting all the starred sections in the first five chapters and covering instead the first part of Chapter 6. The material in the first five chapters has been used at the University of Toronto in an introductory junior-level required course for electrical engineers. </p><p>A one-semester course on random processes with Markov chains can be taught using Chapters 6 though 8. A quick introduction to Markov chains and queueing theory is possible by covering only the first three sections of Chapter 8 and then proceeding to the first few sections in Chapter 9. A one-semester introduction to queueing theory can be taught from Chapters 6, 8, and 9. Changes in the Second Edition </p><p>The only changes in the second edition that affect the first half of the book, and hence introductory courses on probability, involve the addition of more examples and problems. In keeping with our goal of giving the instructor flexibility in the selection of topics, we have expanded the optional section on reliability (Section 3.10) and introduced a new optional section on entropy (Section 3.12). Care has been taken not just to define the various quantities associated with entropy but also to develop an understanding of the interpretation of entropy as a measure of uncertainty and information. </p><p>The most significant change to the second edition is the addition of material to make the text more suitable for a course that provides a more substantial introduction to random processes:</p><p></p><p>In Chapter 4, a section on the joint characteristic function has been added and the discussion of jointly Gaussian random variables has been expanded. </p><p>Section 5.5 discusses the various types of convergence of sequences of random variables. A carefully selected set of examples is presented to demonstrate the differences in the various types of convergence. </p><p>Section 6.6 uses these results to develop the notions of mean square continuity, derivatives, and integrals of random processes. This section presents the relations between the Wiener process and white Gaussian noise. It also develops the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process as the transient solution to a first-order linear system driven by noise. </p><p>Section 6.8 uses Fourier series to introduce the notion of representing a random process by a linear combination of deterministic functions weighted by random variables. It then proceeds to develop the Karhunen-Loeve expansion for vector random variables and then random processes. </p><p>Section 7.4 now contains a separate section on prediction and the Levinson algorithm. </p><p>Finally, Section 7.5 presents a discussion of the Kalman filter to complement the Wiener filter introduced in Section 7.4.

Combining compelling narrative storytelling with analysis, Joseph W. Bendersky offers an authoritative survey of the major political, economic, and social factors that powered the rise and fall of the Third Reich. Now in its fourth edition, the book incorporates significant research of recent years, analysis of the politics of memory, postwar German controversies about World War II and the Nazi era, and more on non-Jewish victims. Delving into the complexity of social life within the Nazi state, it also reemphasizes the crucial role played by racial ideology in determining the policies and practices of the Third Reich. Bendersky paints a fascinating picture of how average citizens negotiated their way through both the threatening power behind certain Nazi policies and the strong enticements to acquiesce or collaborate. His classic treatment provides an invaluable overview of a subject that retains its historical significance and contemporary importance.</p><p>Joseph W. Bendersky is professor of history at Virginia Commonwealth University.Joseph Benderksy's new edition of A Concise History of Nazi Germany manages to be concise and comprehensive&#x2014;as well as up-to-date. I have used earlier editions in my courses on twentieth-century Germany with great success. It leads students through Nazism from its inception in post&#x2013;World War I Germany to the years of the Third Reich and then into what he calls the &#x2018;intractable Nazi legacy&#x2019; that lives on to this day. Nazism, it seems, will not go away. This book provides students with a solid platform from which to launch their exploration of the effects and the meaning of the Nazi phenomenon. (Karl A. Schleunes, University of North Carolina at Greensboro)<br><br>Bendersky's history is an excellent, well-written introduction to the major issues and complicated structure of Nazi Germany. His text complements monographs on specific topics and equips students to handle them better. (Richard Breitman, American University)<br><br>Incorporating significant research of recent years, analysis of the politics of memory, German controversies and more material on non-Jewish victims of the war, Bendersky examines concisely the rise and fall of the Third Reich. He begins with the origins and development of Nazism from 1919 to 1928, discussing the Weimar Republic in crisis, the rise of Hitler, the history of the roots of Nazi ideology, and party structure, propaganda, and followers during the early days. He then works through the seizure and consolidation of power from 1929 to 1934, including the parliamentary struggles for power, Hitler's use and abuse of the legal system, the nazification of German society from 1934 to 1938, and the rise and fall of Nazism in Europe from 1933 to 1945. He closes with the aforesaid material on the current struggle for justice and accurate historical memory.

Students and practitioners of social work need to understand how these people experience the world. To that end, Leigh first provides background on becoming a culturally competent social worker and then focuses on the beginning stage of the helping process--interviewing. This much-needed text features a highly regarded ethnographic interview model that casts clients in the role of experts on their own lives. Readers learn how to gather information that fosters a positive relationship between helper and client, eventually leading to a culturally congruent assessment and treatment plan. In addition, end of chapter exercises; excerpts of interviews; and detailed information on assessment, negotiated consensus treatment planning, and culturally relevant interventions enhance readers&#39; learning experience.</p><p>Of related interest from Waveland Press: Iglehart-Becerra, <i>Social Services and the Ethnic Community: History and Analysis,</i> Second Edition (ISBN 9781577666820)."I love the communication focus!!

One time our table of six giggled through the entire meal, losing it every time we glanced toward Sister Anne Meridier, who&#x2019;d pinned the placard &#x201c;Unrecollected&#x201d; upside down on her pious little head. It doesn&#x2019;t help matters that meals are supposed to be eaten in solemn silence.<br><br>I have to say that the main reason I&#x2019;m wearing this &#x201c;Most uncharitable&#x201d; placard is because of Sister Roseanne (not her real name). She has one of those bossy, pushy personalities, and in the close, constricted life of the novitiate&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. well, that can drive you nuts. Sister Roseanne had rushed to be the first one to arrive at the novitiate on entrance day, knowing that the &#x201c;band&#x201d; (class entering together) would be referred to as &#x201c;Sister Roseanne&#x2019;s Band.&#x201d; It burned me up that she did that, which proved to be but a small harbinger of her dominating character. And now that everything in the novitiate is recoded into religious ideals, she&#x2019;s doing her level best to be Number One Novice&#x2014;�even in holiness.<br><br>Well, to be truthful, competition gets me going, so at first sound of the 5:00 a.m. bell (the bell is the voice of God) the two of us throw on all ten pieces of the holy habit&#x2014;�kissing dress, veil, and rosary as we go&#x2014;�and race lickety-�split to be first in the chapel for morning prayers. All it took to launch the race was a casual remark of our novice mistress that a really fervent novice would not only be on time for prayers but would hasten to the chapel early so she could have a few extra minutes with our blessed Lord. That was it. The race was on.<br><br>Another thing that galls me about Roseanne is that during meditation&#x2014;�she sits right behind me in chapel&#x2014;�she&#x2019;s always fiddling and rustling. She can&#x2019;t keep her hands still, cleaning one fingernail with another, click, click, click, and sighing deeply, one sigh after another. They reverberate seismically through the chapel&#x2014;�where, with everyone quietly meditating, you can hear your own breathing. So imagine click, click, sigh behind you constantly when you&#x2019;re trying very, very hard to quiet your soul and enter into the depths of mystical prayer with God.<br><br>At our weekly conference, our novice mistress, Mother Noemi, talks to us about putting up with one another&#x2019;s faults and foibles. Now, there&#x2019;s a new nun word, foible, part of a whole new lexicon I&#x2019;m learning, like edifying (good example), and modesty of the eyes (eyes lowered to avoid distractions), and religious decorum, which covers a multitude of actions: speech (demure, never raucous), walking (never swinging arms), singing (like the angels with clear notes and blending voices), politeness (answering &#x201c;Yes, Mother,&#x201d; &#x201c;Yes, Sister&#x201d;; avoiding nicknames), and even blowing your nose in nunly fashion (with men&#x2019;s large white handkerchiefs).<br><br>And now foible, a quaint little word if ever there was one. I&#x2019;ve seen it written but never heard it used by real people in real conversations. Well, ol&#x2019; Click may well be the Foible Queen of the World. As far as I know, I don&#x2019;t have too many foibles, but you can never be sure. As Mother says, self-�knowledge is hard to come by; we all have blind spots because of pride, which we&#x2019;re born with as Daughters of Eve, and pride blinds, while humility opens the eyes of the soul.<br><br>Lord knows I need humility just to handle Click. I&#x2019;m praying for a divine infusion of grace to overcome all the mean-�spirited things I hope happen to Roseanne, the most benign of which is that Mother will move her place in chapel and foist her onto other poor souls. And it is such thoughts that now bring me to my knees at the feet of Mother Anthelma.<br><br>I&#x2019;m nineteen years old, the year is 1958, and I&#x2019;ve already made it through the first nine months of probation (called &#x201c;postulancy&#x201d;) and am now a first-�year novice at St. Joseph Novitiate in New Orleans. More than anything in the world I want to be a holy nun in love with God. I want to be a saint. And, according to Catholic teaching, by joining the religious life I&#x2019;m choosing the most direct route to sainthood. By my vows I will become a spouse of Jesus Christ.<br><br>Or, rather, as I am learning, I am chosen by Jesus because you can&#x2019;t simply declare yourself chosen and become a nun just like that, because that might be self-�will, not God&#x2019;s will. Jesus said, &#x201c;You have not chosen me but I have chosen you,&#x201d; so you have to be invited and you have to pray long and hard, listening to your deep-�down soul to hear the call. Then you have to ask admittance to the community, and merely because you&#x2019;re asking doesn&#x2019;t mean they&#x2019;ll accept you, and I prayed and prayed and wrote and rewrote my application to Mother Mary Anthelma, the superior, asking to be admitted to the novitiate. I also had to have my parish priest, Father Marionneaux, write to Mother Anthelma to assure the community that I was a Catholic in good standing. The novitiate, where I am now, is the training ground, the place where you and the community see if there&#x2019;s a &#x201c;fit.&#x201d;<br><br>In senior religion class at St. Joseph&#x2019;s Academy, where I went to high school, Father William Borders taught us that religious life, or the Life of Perfection, is the &#x201c;highest&#x201d; state of life for a Christian, higher than marriage and the single life. That&#x2019;s because the other states of life must be lived in the world, which is full of traps, seductions, and temptations&#x2014;�all lures of Satan, who is hell-�bent, you better believe it, on separating souls from God.<br><br>I still have a pocket-�sized New Testament given to me by my sister, Mary Ann, on my entrance day into the community. In it she inscribed:<br><br>To my favorite sister, Helen [I&#x2019;m her only sister, her little joke]<br><br>I hope that you shall be very happy. You are one of God&#x2019;s children who has been chosen to be in His special family. I&#x2019;m very proud to tell people that I have a sister in the convent praying for me. I will need your prayers, Helen, for the way of life I have chosen is a worldly one, and I&#x2019;ll have many obstacles in my way. I shall remember you always in my prayers. May you love God always and stay close to Him, as you are now.<br><br>All my love,<br><br>Mary<br><br>The highest state of life? A life of seeking perfection? Bride of Christ? I always did have high ambitions. When I was in eighth grade I announced to Sister Mark and my classmates that I intended to become either the Pope or president of the United States. A joke, of course, thrown out with a thirteen-�year-�old&#x2019;s flippancy, and everyone laughed, but even then I harbored within my young breast a desire for greatness. After all, as president of our class had I not already exhibited solid, if not brilliant, leadership? When Maxine, our dearly loved classmate, was forced to leave us because her father was transferred away from Louisiana to the other end of the world&#x2014;�somewhere way up north like Detroit&#x2014;�had I not given a stirring speech of farewell, which moved many to tears, including Maxine herself (and almost me myself, had I not hung strenuously onto my self-�control)? I reached this pinnacle of emotion in my speech simply by pointing out that Maxine&#x2019;s passage from us was truly a form of death, for we, remaining in Baton Rouge, would probably never see her alive again this side of the grave.</p><h2>The Edible Front Yard: The Mow-Less, Grow-More Plan for a Beautiful, Bountiful Garden</h2><p><p><b>&#x201c;Front lawns, beware: The Germinatrix has you in her crosshairs!

Harcover book in slip-cover. The first standalone tale of Middle-earth since 1977. Christopher Tolkien constructed the narrative from J.R.R. Tolkien&#39;s original manuscripts, using many sources from various decades.</p><p>The first complete book by J.R.R. Tolkien in three decades--since the publication of <i>The Silmarillion</i> in 1977--<i>The Children of H�rin</i> reunites fans of <i>The Hobbit</i> and <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> with Elves and Men, dragons and Dwarves, Eagles and Orcs. Presented for the first time as a complete, standalone story, this stirring narrative will appeal to casual fans and expert readers alike, returning them to the rich landscape and characters unique to Tolkien. <p> </p><p> <strong>Adam Tolkien on <i>The Children of H�rin</i></strong> </p><p> How did a lifetime of stories become <i>The Children of H�rin</i>? In an essay on the making of the book, Adam Tolkien, grandson of J.R.R. Tolkien (and French translator of his <i>History of Middle-earth</i>), explains that the H�rin legends made up the third "Great Tale" of his grandfather's Middle-earth writing, and he describes how his father, Christopher Tolkien, painstakingly collected the pieces of the legend into a complete story told only in the words of J.R.R. Tolkien. "For anyone who has read <i>The Hobbit</i> and <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>," he writes, <i>The Children of H�rin</i> "allows them to take a step back into a larger world, an ancient land of heroes and vagabonds, honour and jeopardy, hope and tragedy." </p><p> </p><p> <strong>A Look Inside the Book</strong> </p><p> This first edition of <i>The Children of H�rin</i> is illustrated by Alan Lee, who was already well-known for his Tolkien illustrations in previous editions (see our Tolkien Store for more) as well as his classic collaboration with Brian Froud, <i>Faeries</i>, and his Kate Greenaway Medal-winning <i>Black Ships Before Troy</i>, before his Oscar-winning work as conceptual designer for Peter Jackson's <i>Lord of the Rings</i> film trilogy brought him even greater acclaim. Here's a quick glimpse of two of Lee's interior illustrations for <i>The Children of H�rin</i>. (Click on each to see larger images.) </p><p> </p><table> <tbody><tr> <td></td> <td></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p></p><p> </p><p> <strong>Questions for Alan Lee</strong> </p><p> We had the chance to ask Alan Lee a few questions about his illustrative collaboration with the world imagined by J.R.R. Tolkien: </p><p> <strong>Amazon.com:</strong> How much of a treat was it to get first crack at depicting entirely new characters rather than ones who had been interpreted many times before? Was there one who particularly captured your imagination? </p><p><strong>Lee:</strong> Although it was a great honor to illustrate <i>The Children of H�rin</i>, the characters and the main elements of the story line are familiar to those who have read <i>The Silmarillion</i> and <i>Unfinished Tales</i>, and these narratives have inspired quite a few illustrators. Ted Nasmith has illustrated <i>The Silmarillion</i> and touched on some of the same characters and landscapes. This was the first time that I ventured into the First Age; while working on <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> books and films--and <i>The Hobbit</i>--I've had to refer back to events in Middle-earth history but not really depict them. </p><p> I'm drawn to characters who bear similarities to the protagonists in myths and legends; these correspondences add layers and shades of meaning, and most of the characters in this story have those archetypal qualities. However, I prefer not to get too close to the characters because the author is delineating them much more carefully than I can, and I'm wary of interfering with the pictures that the text is creating in the reader's mind. </p><p><strong>Amazon.com:</strong> The H�rin story has been described as darker than some of Tolkien's other work. What mood did you try to set with your illustrations? </p><p><strong>Lee:</strong> It is a tragic story, but the darkness is offset by the light and beauty of Tolkien's elegiac writing. In the illustrations I tried to show some of the fragile beauty of the landscapes and create an atmosphere that would enhance the sense of foreboding and impending loss. I try to get the setting to tell its part in the story, as evidence of what happened there in the past and as a hint at what is going to occur. My usual scarred and broken trees came in handy. </p><p><strong>Amazon.com:</strong> You were a conceptual designer (and won an Oscar) for Peter Jackson's film trilogy of <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>, which I think we can safely say had a bit of success. How does designing for the screen compare to designing for the page? </p><p><strong>Lee:</strong> They both have their share of joys and frustrations. It was great to be part of a huge film collaboration and play a small part in something quite magical and monumental; I will always treasure that experience. Film is attractive because I enjoy sketching and coming up with ideas more than producing highly finished artwork, and it's great having several hundred other people lending a hand! But books--as long as they don't get moldy from being left in an empty studio for six years--have their own special quality. I hope that I can continue doing both. </p><p><strong>Amazon.com:</strong> Of all fiction genres, fantasy seems to have the strongest tradition of illustration. Why do you think that is? Who are some of your favorite illustrators? </p><p><strong>Lee:</strong> A lot of excellent illustrators are working at the moment--especially in fantasy and children's books. It is exciting also to see graphic artists such as Dave McKean, in his film <i>Mirrormask</i>, moving between different media. I also greatly admire the more traditional work of Gennady Spirin and Roberto Innocenti. Kinuko Craft, John Jude Palencar, John Howe, Charles Vess, Brian Froud ... I'll stop there, as the list would get too long. But--in a fit of pride and justified nepotism--I'll add my daughter, Virginia Lee, to the list. Her first illustrated children's book, <i>The Frog Bride</i> [coming out in the U.K. in September], will be lovely. </p> <p></p><p> </p><p> <strong>More Tolkien Favorites</strong> </p><p>Visit our J.R.R.

This rare volume, signed and dated 1815 by Elizabeth M. Townshend, appears to be just such a collection &#x2014; an authentic treasury of embroidery designs dating from the early days of the Republic.<br>Brimming with nearly 200 timeless, functional designs, this priceless sourcebook ranges from highly stylized repeat patterns, to more realistic floral bouquets, to traditional patterns for cutwork edgings, to large-scale motifs suitable for crewel embroidery. You'll find miniature baskets (a popular motif of the day) and dainty leaf patterns, planned perhaps for a petticoat or waistcoat. Other lovely designs are ideal for embellishing the collar or cuffs of a favorite dress, adding an elegant touch to linens, curtains, undergarments, tablecloths, etc.<br>While most of the patterns are small in scale and probably intended for use with silk threads, several are particularly effective worked in wool. The stitches Elizabeth Townshend would have used are the same stitches we use today &#x2014; seed stitch, outline, and stem stitches, chain stitch, loop stitch, and herringbone stitch &#x2014; making these appealing designs as accessible to modern embroidery enthusiasts as they were to the nation's first needle artists.<br><i>Early American Embroidery Designs</i> is not only a treasury of needlework inspiration; it's an authentic slice of Americana.

It&#x2019;s the summer of 1965 and Emily, Vincent, and Marsha are at the beach. All three are ambitious and artistic; all are hovering around thirty; and all are deeply and mercilessly invested in analyzing themselves and everyone around them. The friends discuss sex, shrinks, psychedelics, sculpture, and S and M in an ongoing dialogue where anything goes and no topic is off limits. <i>Talk</i> is the result of these conversations, recorded by Linda Rosenkrantz and transformed into a novel whose form and content put it well ahead of its time.

Only her eyes jumped from place to place. In a breeze, her bright-red hair might stir, but she would not. Even then, there was profundity in her repose. When my fourth daughter was an infant, I wondered if her veins were full of ants. Placing her against a shoulder was a risk both to her and to the shoulder. Impulsively, constantly, everything about her moved. Her head seemed about to revolve as it followed the bestirring world. These memories became very much alive some months ago when--one after another--I had bear cubs under my vest. Weighing three, four, 5.6 pounds, they were wild bears, and for an hour or so had been taken from their dens in Pennsylvania. They were about two months old, with fine short brown hair. When they were made to stand alone, to be photographed in the mouth of a den, they shivered. Instinctively, a person would be moved to hold them. Picked up by the scruff of the neck, they splayed their paws like kittens and screamed like baby bears. The cry of ababy bear is muted, like a human infant's heard from her crib down the hall. The first cub I placed on my shoulder stayed there like a piece of velvet. The shivering stopped. Her bright-blue eyes looked about, not seeing much of anything. My hand, cupped against her back, all but encompassed her rib cage, which was warm and calm. I covered her to the shoulders with a flap of down vest and zipped up my parka to hold her in place. I was there by invitation, an indirect result of work I had been doing nearby. Would I be busy on March 14th? If there had been a conflict--if, say, I had been invited to lunch on that day with the Queen of Scotland and the King of Spain--I would have gone to the cubs. The first den was a rock cavity in a lichen-covered sandstone outcrop near the top of a slope, a couple of hundred yards from a road in Hawley. It was on posted property of the Scrub Oak Hunting Club--dry hardwood forest underlain by laurel and patches of snow--in the northern Pocono woods. Up in the sky was Buck Alt. Not long ago, he was a dairy farmer, and now he was working for the Keystone State, with directional antennae on his wing struts angled in the direction of bears. Many bears in Pennsylvania have radios around their necks as a result of the summer trapping work of Alt's son Gary, who is a wildlife biologist. In winter, Buck Alt flies the country listening to the radio, crissing and crossing until the bears come on. They come on stronger the closer to them he flies. The transmitters are not omnidirectional. Suddenly, the sound cuts out. Buck looks down, chooses a landmark, approaches it again, on another vector. Gradually, he works his way in, until he is flying in ever tighter circles above the bear. He marks a map. He is accurate within two acres. The plane he flies is a Super Cub. The den could have served as a set for a Passion play. Itwas a small chamber, open on one side, with a rock across its entrance. Between the freestanding rock and the back of the cave was room for one large bear, and she was curled in a corner on a bed of leaves, her broad head plainly visible from the outside, her cubs invisible between the rock and a soft place, chuckling, suckling, in the wintertime tropics of their own mammalian heaven. Invisible they were, yes, but by no means inaudible. What biologists call chuckling sounded like starlings in a tree. People walking in woods sometimes come close enough to a den to cause the mother to get up and run off, unmindful of her reputation as a fearless defender of cubs. The cubs stop chuckling and begin to cry: possibly three, four cubs--a ward of mewling bears. The people hear the crying. They find the den and see the cubs. Sometimes they pick them up and carry them away, reporting to the state that they have saved the lives of bear cubs abandoned by their mother. Wherever and whenever this occurs, Gary Alt collects the cubs. After ten years of bear trapping and biological study, Alt has equipped so many sows with radios that he has been able to conduct a foster-mother program with an amazingly high rate of success. A mother in hibernation will readily accept a foster cub. If the need to place an orphan arises somewhat later, when mothers and their cubs are out and around, a sow will kill an alien cub as soon as she smells it. Alt has overcome this problem by stuffing sows' noses with Vicks VapoRub. One way or another, he has found new families for forty-seven orphaned cubs. Forty-six have survived. The other, which had become accustomed over three weeks to feedings and caresses by human hands, was not content in a foster den, crawled outside, and died in the snow. With a hypodermic jab stick, Alt now drugged themother, putting her to sleep for the duration of the visit. From deeps of shining fur, he fished out cubs. One. Two. A third. A fourth. Five! The fifth was a foster daughter brought earlier in the winter from two hundred miles away. Three of the four others were male--a ratio consistent with the heavy preponderance of males that Alt's studies have shown through the years. To various onlookers he handed the cubs for safekeeping while he and several assistants carried the mother into the open and weighed her with block and tackle. To protect her eyes, Alt had blindfolded her with a red bandanna. They carried her upside down, being extremely careful lest they scrape and damage her nipples. She weighed two hundred and nineteen pounds. Alt had caught her and weighed her some months before. In the den, she had lost ninety pounds. When she was four years old, she had had four cubs; two years later, four more cubs; and now, after two more years, four cubs. He knew all that about her, he had caught her so many times. He referred to her as Daisy. Daisy was as nothing compared with Vanessa, who was sleeping off the winter somewhere else. In ten seasons, Vanessa had given birth to twenty-three cubs and had lost none. The growth and reproductive rates of black bears are greater in Pennsylvania than anywhere else. Black bears in Pennsylvania grow more rapidly than grizzlies in Montana. Eastern black bears are generally much larger than Western ones. A seven-hundred-pound bear is unusual but not rare in Pennsylvania. Alt once caught a big boar like that who had a thirty-seven-inch neck and was a hair under seven feet long. This bear, nose to tail, measured five feet five. Alt said, "That's a nice long sow." For weighing the cubs, he had a small nylon stuff sack. He stuffed it with bear and hung it on a scale. Two months before, when the cubs were born,each would have weighed approximately half a pound--less than a newborn porcupine. Now the cubs weighed 3.4, 4.1, 4.4, 4.6, 5.6--cute little numbers with soft tan noses and erectile pyramid ears. Bears have sex in June and July, but the mother's system holds the fertilized egg away from the uterus until November, when implantation occurs. Fetal development lasts scarcely six weeks. Therefore, the creatures who live upon the hibernating mother are so small that everyone survives. The orphan, less winsome than the others, looked like a chocolate-covered possum. I kept her under my vest. She seemed content there and scarcely moved. In time, I exchanged her for 5.6--the big boy in the litter. Lifted by the scruff and held in the air, he bawled, flashed his claws, and curled his lips like a woofing boar. I stuffed him under the vest, where he shut up and nuzzled. His claws were already more than half an inch long. Alt said that the family would come out of the den in a few weeks but that much of the spring would go by before the cubs gained weight. The difference would be that they were no longer malleable and ductile. They would become pugnacious and scratchy, not to say vicious, and would chew up the hand that caressed them. He said, "If you have an enemy, give him a bear cub." Six men carried the mother back to the den, the red bandanna still tied around her eyes. Alt repacked her into the rock. "We like to return her to the den as close as possible to the way we found her," he said. Someone remarked that one biologist can work a coon, while an army is needed to deal with a bear. An army seemed to be present. Twelve people had followed Alt to the den. Some days, the group around him is four times as large. Alt, who is in his thirties, was wearing a visored khaki cap with a blue-and-gold keystone on the forehead, and a khaki cardigan under akhaki jump suit. A lithe and light-bodied man with tinted glasses and a blond mustache, he looked like a lieutenant in the Ardennes Forest. Included in the retinue were two reporters and a news photographer. Alt encourages media attention, the better to soften the image of the bears. He says, "People fear bears more than they need to, and respect them not enough." Over the next twenty days, he had scheduled four hundred visitors--state senators, representatives, commissioners, television reporters, word processors, biologists, friends--to go along on his rounds of dens. Days before, he and the denned bears had been hosts to the BBC. The Brits wanted snow. God was having none of it. The BBC brought in the snow. In the course of the day, we made a brief tour of dens that for the time being stood vacant. Most were rock cavities. They had been used before, and in all likelihood would be used again. Bears in winter in the Pocono Plateau are like chocolate chips in a cookie. The bears seldom go back to the same den two years running, and they often change dens in the course of a winter. In a forty-five-hundred-acre housing development called Hemlock Farms are twenty-three dens known to be in current use and countless others awaiting new tenants. Alt showed one that was within fifteen feet of the intersection of East Spur Court and Pommel Drive. He said that when a sow with two cubs was in there he had seen deer browsing by the outcrop and ignorant dogs stopping off to lift a leg. Hemlock Farms is exp...</p><h2>A Guide to Medicinal Plants of Appalachia</h2><p>The medicinal or therapeutic uses of the plants described in this guide are not to be construed in any way as recommendation by the authors or the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

To become an expert you must balance many concepts, some of which occasionally contradict each other. In 1988, the first edition appeared. Many ideas, which were only known to a small, select group of players, were made available to anyone who was striving to become an expert, and the hold &#39;em explosion had begun. It is now a new century, and the authors have again moved the state of the art forward by adding over 100 pages of new material, including extensive sections on &#34;loose games,&#34; and &#34;short-handed games.&#34; Anyone who studies this text, is well disciplined, and gets the proper experience should become a significant winner. Some of the other ideas discussed include play on the first two cards, semibluffing, the free card, inducing bluffs, staying with a draw, playing when a pair flops, playing trash hands, desperation bets, playing in wild games, reading hands, and psychology.</p><p>About David Sklansky <p>David Sklansky is generally considered the number one authority on gambling in the world today. Besides his ten books on the subject, David also has produced two videos and numerous writings for various gaming publications. His occasional poker seminars always receive an enthusiastic reception, including those given at the Taj Mahal in Atlantic City and the World Series of Poker in Las Vegas. </p><p>More recently, David has been doing consulting work for casinos, Internet gaming sites, and gaming device companies. He has recently invented several games, soon to appear in casinos. </p><p>David attributes his standing in the gambling community to three things: </p><p>1. The fact that he presents his ideas as simply as possible (sometimes with Mason Malmuth) even though these ideas frequently involve concepts that are deep, subtle, and not to be found elsewhere. </p><p>2. The fact that the things he says and writes can be counted on to be accurate. </p><p>3. The fact that to this day a large portion of his income is still derived from gambling (usually poker, but occasionally blackjack, sports betting, horses, video games, casino promotions, or casino tournaments). </p><p>Thus, those who depend on David&#x2019;s advice know that he still depends on it himself. </p><p>About Mason Malmuth </p><p>Mason Malmuth was born and raised in Coral Gables, Florida. In 1973 he received his BS in Mathematics from Virginia Tech, and completed their Masters&#x2019; program in 1975. While working for the United States Census Bureau in 1978, Mason stopped overnight in Las Vegas while driving to his new assignment in California. He was immediately fascinated by the games, and gambling became his major interest. </p><p>After arriving in California he discovered that poker was legal and began playing in some of the public cardrooms as well as taking periodic trips to Las Vegas where he would play both poker and blackjack. In 1981 he went to work for the Northrop Corporation as a mathematician and moved to Los Angeles where he could conviently pursue his interest in poker in the large public cardrooms in Gardena, Bell Gardens, and Commerce. </p><p>In 1983 his first article "Card Domination &#x2014; The Ultimate Blackjack Weapon" was published in Gambling Times magazine. In 1987 he left his job with the Northrop Corporation to begin a career as both a full-time gambler and a gambling writer. He has had over 500 articles published in various magazines and is the author or co-author of 12 books. These include Gambling Theory and Other Topics, where he tries to demonstrate why only a small number of people are highly successful at gambling. In this book he introduces the reader to the concept of "non-self weighting strategies" and explains why successful gambling is actually a balance of luck and skill. Other books he has co-authored are Hold &#x2019;em Poker For Advanced Players, written with David Sklansky, and Seven-Card Stud For Advanced Players written with David Sklansky and Ray Zee. All the "advanced" books are considered the definitive works on these games. </p><p>His company Two Plus Two Publishing has sold over 400,000 books and currently has 26 titles to its credit. These books are recognized as the best in their field and are thoroughly studied by those individuals who take gambling seriously.</p></p><h2>They Called Him Wild Bill: The Life and Adventures of James Butler Hickok</h2><p>His contemporaries called him Wild Bill, and newspapermen and others made him a legend in his own time. Among western characters only General George Armstrong Custer and Buffalo Bill Cody are as readily recognized by the general public. In writing this biography, Joseph G. Rosa has expressed the hope that "Hickok emerges as a man and not a legend."<br><br> For this comprehensive revision of his earlier biography of Wild Bill the author was allowed to work from newly available materials in the possession of the Hickok family. He also discovered new material pertaining to Wild Bill&#x2019;s Civil War exploits and his service as a marshal and found the pardon file of his murderer, John McCall. Additional, rare photographs of Wild Bill are published here for the first time. The results of Rosa&#x2019;s additional research make this second edition the best biography of Wild Bill likely to be written for years to come.</p><p><p><b>Joseph G.

You don't need much more than that." Sophie Potter confided the recipe for her delectable piecrust in an unusually serious tone. "Easy, right?"<br><br>"Very easy." Zoey Bates nodded, noticing a dash of flour across Sophie's cheek that was a perfect match to the wispy bun at the back of her head.<br><br>They were both elbow-deep in ingredients while neat rows of pans on the long wooden table waited to be filled with apple, pumpkin, or pecan. Zoey would deliver most of the pies to church tomorrow, to be tucked into boxes and baskets of Thanksgiving meals and sent out to families facing difficult times.<br><br>Sophie would bring one of each to the Potters' family gathering at her daughter Evelyn's house. And Zoey would take one or two home for her family's holiday dinner, too.<br><br>"I bet my dad is going to say, 'Why aren't you ever interested in my cooking lessons?'" Zoey imitated her father's voice perfectly. "He always wants to teach me stuff at the diner. But I know he gets most of the cakes and pies from a big commercial bakery. Even though the menu says 'homemade.'"<br><br>Sophie laughed and swept a knife edge over a heaping cup of flour to level it. "I'm sure your father can teach you a lot about cooking, too. My girls didn't have any patience to learn from me, either. Now they teach me a thing or two. Evelyn barely agreed to let me bring dessert for Thanksgiving. She'd have me sitting in an easy chair all day, watching TV. Or something equally useless. I didn't dare tell her I was baking for the church baskets."<br><br>Sophie's daughter Evelyn lived in town with her family and was still a member of the church she had been raised in, the stone church on the village green, where Zoey's family also attended.<br><br>"She'll probably hear about it on Sunday. If she hasn't already. You know how Reverend Ben thanks everybody at the service."<br><br>"By then the pies will be long baked and eaten. She won't be able to put up too much of a fuss." Sophie wore a mischievous grin as she mixed the dry ingredients. "You can add a dash of cinnamon and nutmeg, to give it some backbone. But not too much."<br><br>Sophie slipped on her glasses before carefully tilting each shaker. She added the spices to the first bowl, then held them out to Zoey. "Here, you try."<br><br>Zoey was dicing butter with a special hand tool, as instructed, and felt comfortable with that job. Spices seemed much trickier. "Maybe you should do it. I don't want to ruin the dough."<br><br>"Nonsense. How can you learn? Cooking is a lot like life, honey. You're going to make mistakes, but most can be fixed. Start with a light touch, and you'll do fine."<br><br>Zoey took the shaker and followed Sophie's advice, sprinkling carefully.<br><br>"Perfect." Sophie mixed more flour, and Zoey continued with the butter.<br><br>"How many people will be at your daughter's house?"<br><br>Sophie squinted a moment. "Let's see . . . With my grandson's fianc&#x17d;e and my nephew's baby, at least twenty-five. We'll need two big tables-and two turkeys-for sure."<br><br>The Potter family tree spread far and wide, and Zoey was not familiar with all of Sophie's relatives; just those who lived in and around Cape Light. She did know others by their photographs, which covered nearly every table, ledge, and wall of the old house.<br><br>"That's a lot. Even with the Tulleys and Grandma Dooley, we'll only be eight."<br><br>"A small gathering is nice. You can have a real conversation at the table. When the Potter clan gets together, it's mayhem."<br><br>"We're not that many people, but it's never that quiet. Not if there's a football game on." Zoey was thinking about her two stepbrothers and her father. Loud when they were happy and their team was winning, and loud if the game was going the other way.<br><br>Zoey had not grown up in the Bates household. She had been taken in by Lucy and Charlie Bates about five years ago, when she ran away from a foster home and ended up in the Clam Box one rainy, cold winter night. With barely a dollar in her pocket and nowhere to go, she was so sick with the flu, she could hardly stand. Kindhearted Lucy persuaded Zoey to come home with her and Charlie, and what began as a one-night respite from her hard, chaotic life evolved into Zoey finding the loving family and real home she had never known. Lucy and Charlie had adopted her, and Zoey now thought of them as her real parents, and even called them Mom and Dad.<br><br>Sophie shook her head. "Football. If they're not watching it, they're all outside, tackling each other. I tried keeping the game off one year. You would think I'd changed the menu to peanut butter and jelly sandwiches."<br><br>Sophie rubbed flour on the rolling pin, a good deal of it powdering her soft arms. "Not my call to make this year. I'm not the hostess." She sighed and suddenly looked serious. "This isn't the first time I'm not having the family for Thanksgiving, but for some reason, it feels like it. Other times, it was my choice to let Evelyn or Una take a turn. This year, they all said they wouldn't allow it. That's what makes it different. I'm afraid they're going to try to take Christmas away from me, too."<br><br>Zoey met Sophie's glance and found a defeated look. Defeated and frightened. As if the new rules her children had set down about holiday entertaining warned of bigger battles to come.<br><br>"They're worried about you, Sophie. They don't want you to run yourself down and get sick again, like last winter."<br><br>"Oh, that bug was a fluke. I was never sick a day in my life before that. I'm still working outside in all types of weather."<br><br>The declaration had been true for decades, but was actually not as accurate now. "You were in the hospital for weeks and needed a nurse here every day when you got home."<br><br>Zoey remembered the Sunday announcements in church last February; Reverend Ben asking for prayers for Sophie, who was in the hospital with double pneumonia, even in critical condition at one point. But through the grace of God and her own strong will, Sophie had survived. She had required nursing care at home for months, and visits from friends and neighbors as well. That was when Zoey had begun visiting Sophie, first as a member of the church's Care and Concern group and, soon after, as a real friend. Now Zoey cherished Sophie as more than a friend. Her connection to Sophie felt like family.<br><br>Zoey did have Grandma Dooley, Lucy's mother, who had been delighted to finally have a granddaughter to shop for. But they weren't nearly as close as she and Sophie, who was so much fun to talk to and made her feel ten feet tall for the smallest accomplishment. An unlikely friend for a college student, it was true, but Zoey often thought of Sophie as her "real" grandmother, though she had never said it aloud.<br><br>"It was rough sledding for a while," Sophie finally admitted. "But I bounced back, a hundred percent. Even the doctor says so. Thank goodness I talked them into letting me come home instead of shipping me off to one of those cookie-cutter assisted living places. Bet they wouldn't let me keep Mac in a place like that."<br><br>At the sound of his name, Sophie's dog, Macintosh, who was curled up in his dog bed in a corner of the kitchen, lifted his soft, furry head and met Sophie's glance with an alert look.<br><br>"It's all right, Mac. I'm not going anywhere without you," Sophie promised. Comforted by her tone, the border-collie mix settled down and closed his eyes again.<br><br>Mac was the perfect dog for Sophie, Zoey thought. Medium-sized, with a shaggy, brown and white coat, he was still nimble enough to steal food off the counter in a flash, yet he had the steady, affectionate temperament of a Labrador. Zoey couldn't imagine Sophie's house without him.<br><br>Sophie continued kneading the dough with surprising strength for a woman her age. "Or they'd have me move in with Evelyn. It's hard to say if Mac's included in that long-standing invitation, either. My kids want me to sell this place, no secret there. But I'm not leaving this house on my own two feet. They know that, too."<br><br>Zoey hated the idea of Sophie selling the orchard, but she could understand how Sophie's family felt. Zoey worried about Sophie, too, and knew that Sophie had resisted hiring help, claiming she had all her friends and family to help her. Especially friends from the church.<br><br>Zoey would have liked to visit Sophie even more than she did, but it was difficult juggling her schedule, with college classes and studying and working at the diner in town that her family owned. She also volunteered at an after-school center for children. Never mind fitting in a social life; even hanging out with girlfriends was a treat these days. Never mind finding a boyfriend, either. She did manage to visit Sophie at least once or twice a week, though she knew that wasn't nearly enough to ensure her safety.<br><br>"It was easier when Miranda and Eric were here. You weren't alone so much," Zoey reminded her.<br><br>"That's true. But they have their own lives. I was grateful for the years Miranda did stay," Sophie added. "She got a great opportunity in North Carolina, working for a big jewelry firm. I would never have wanted her to give that up. But I can't see why the rest of them want me to give up something I love," she reasoned. "Evelyn already talked me into giving up the Christmas Fair. She doesn't want me to be in charge again this year. I agreed after all her pestering. Now what am I supposed to do with myself over the holidays? Sit in the corner and twiddle my thumbs?"<br><br>"Of course not." Zoey was surprised to hear about the fair. Sophie had always been the chairperson of the church's biggest fund-raiser. The fair had been Sophie's idea, over thirty years ago. Giving it up was a big compromise with her daughter. It sounded as if her children were serious this time.<br><br>"Miranda was a godsend. My kids were trying to make me move out back then, too, after my dear Gus died."<br><br>Zoey already knew the story of how Miranda came to live on the orchard. Unable to gain much traction in her acting career, Sophie's granddaughter Miranda came to visit one winter to rest and regroup, soon after Sophie's husband, Gus, had passed away. Miranda had always loved making jewelry, and Cape Light turned out to be a perfect place to develop her craft-and the perfect place to meet the love of her life, Eric Copeland. After they married, they stayed on to help Sophie run the orchard while pursuing their own careers and raising a family.<br><br>But the couple had moved over a year ago, leaving Sophie to manage a staff of seasonal workers on her own. Problems arose that she could no longer handle. Her children, especially her son, Bart, were often called on to step in.<br><br>"Maybe you can figure out some solution, Sophie, some plan your kids will agree to. You never know. Anything can happen."<br><br>"Can the good Lord send me another miracle like Miranda? Only He knows for sure. I've been praying on it. You can count on that."<br><br>"I'll say a prayer, too," Zoey promised.<br><br>"Thanks, honey. I know you will." Sophie's bright blue eyes met Zoey's with a warm look. "I'm also praying that the subject doesn't come up at Thanksgiving dinner. I don't want to spoil the party. I'm hoping it will be too hectic for any serious talk."<br><br>Sophie had poured a big bowl of flour into the first bowl of butter and tossed in a few spoonfuls of ice water, and was now kneading a ball of pale yellow dough with all the pent-up emotion the conversation had inspired.<br><br>"They think they're going to lay down the law and not allow me to have my Christmas party this year. But I'm set on that. And I'll get my way," Sophie promised.<br><br>"I hope so," Zoey said sincerely. "I'll be happy to help you."<br><br>"Thanks, honey. I'm going to take you up on that." Sophie pushed and patted the dough. "Okay, you've seen how it's done. Now you take that other bowl of flour and knead some. I'm going to mix the pumpkin filling. Don't handle it too much. It will get tough," she warned as she pushed a bowl in Zoey's direction.<br><br>"Start with a light touch?" Zoey replied with a grin.<br><br>Sophie nodded, looking pleased. "That's right. A light touch will do it. Most of the time."<br><br>�Oh, dear. This doesn�t look right at all, does it?� Wearing big red kitchen mitts that looked like lobster claws, Emily Warwick carefully carried a pumpkin pie from the oven out to the dining room.<br><br>Her daughter Jane sat at the dining room table, concentrating on a textbook and piles of notes, highlighted and underlined. She lifted her head to watch her mother set the pie on a trivet on the sideboard. The corners of her mouth twitched with a smile. "It's not so bad, Mom," she carefully answered.<br><br>"It's okay, you can laugh." Emily shrugged, smiling now, too.<br><br>"It might be okay if you scrape the burnt part of the crust a little. Is it done in the middle?"<br><br>"I was wondering about that myself. But if I poke it again, it will look even more hideous." Emily glanced back at Jane, and they both laughed. "I only have three more in the oven. They look even worse."<br><br>"You tried. That's what counts. Sorry I had to bug out on you."<br><br>"You have a test. That's more important." Emily glanced at Jane's textbook, Earth Science, opened to a complicated cross-section diagram of a volcano that made her head spin.<br><br>Jane had been talking about the midterm for weeks. Emily knew she should have remembered that before volunteering to bake for the church. She had thought she would do it with her daughter, but had ended up baking, quite unsuccessfully, alone.<br><br>"At least we have the brownies you made after school. Those are perfect," Emily said. "I'll buy some pies tomorrow at Willoughby's. That will solve it."<br><br>"Good plan," Jane agreed with a sly grin.<br><br>"How's the studying coming? Ready to taste test the brownies?" Emily asked hopefully.<br><br>"I think I can take a break for that." Jane stacked her textbooks and notes, then cleared a space on the table.<br><br>Emily returned from the kitchen with two brownies and two glasses of milk. "Hmm. These are good-as good as the bakery's," she said. "I don't know how you learned to cook like this. Your aunt Jessica? I got Grandma's genes for culinary arts."</p><h2>Pastoral Care in Times of Death and Dying</h2><p>Counseling someone who is dying or consoling a family who has suffered a death is one of the hardest parts of ministry.

Rather like Korea itself."--Nicholas D. Kristof, <em>New York Times Book Review</em></strong></p> Korea has endured a "fractured, shattered twentieth century," and this updated edition brings Bruce Cumings's leading history of the modern era into the present. The small country, overshadowed in the imperial era, crammed against great powers during the Cold War, and divided and decimated by the Korean War, has recently seen the first real hints of reunification. But positive movements forward are tempered by frustrating steps backward. In the late 1990s South Korea survived its most severe economic crisis since the Korean War, forcing a successful restructuring of its political economy. Suffering through floods, droughts, and a famine that cost the lives of millions of people, North Korea has been labeled part of an "axis of evil" by the George W. Bush administration and has renewed its nuclear threats. On both sides Korea seems poised to continue its fractured existence on into the new century, with potential ramifications for the rest of the world. 25 illustrations</p><p>Bruce Cumings traces the growth of Korea from a string of competing walled city-states to its present dual nationhood. He examines the ways in which Korean culture has been influenced by Japan and China, and the ways in which it has subtly influenced its more powerful neighbors. Cumings also considers the recent changes in the South, where authoritarianism is giving way to democracy, and in the North, which Cumings depicts as a "socialist corporatist" state more like a neo-Confucian kingdom than a Stalinist regime. <i>Korea's Place in the Sun</i> does much to help Western readers understand the complexities of Korea's past and present.Bruce Cumings is chairman of the history department at the University of Chicago and the author of Korea&#39;s Place in the Sun.

His writings are voluminous and diverse, ranging from satire to disturbing, violent tragedies, from metaphysical theory to moral and political discussions of virtue and anger. Seneca found himself at the turbulent center of Roman imperial power, making him thus an important witness to the Empire's first dynasty, the Julio-Claudians. Exiled by the emperor Claudius in the wake of a sex scandal, he was eventually brought back to Rome to become tutor and, later, speech-writer and advisor to Nero. Seneca was suspected of plotting against Nero, condemned to die, and ultimately took his own life-an act that is one of the most iconic suicides in Western history.<br><br>The life and works of Seneca pose a number of fascinating challenges. How can we reconcile the bloody tragedies with the prose works advocating a life of Stoic tranquility? How are we to balance Seneca the man of principle, who counseled a life of calm and simplicity, with Seneca the man of the moment, who amassed a vast personal fortune in the service of an emperor seen by many, at the time and afterwards, as an insane tyrant? In this definitive and moving biography, Emily Wilson presents Seneca as a man under enormous pressure, struggling for compromise in a world of absolutism. <em>The</em> <em>Greatest Empire </em>offers us the portrait of a life lived perilously in the gap between political realities and philosophical ideals, between what we aspire to be and what we are.<br></p><p><br><strong>Emily Wilson</strong> is Associate Professor of Classical Studies at the University of Pennsylvania.<br><br>"Wilson offers a carefully balanced narrative of Seneca's life that is derived, as it must be, from partial and often contradictory sources" --<em>Christian Century</em> <br><p></p><br>"This is a riveting and complete picture of Seneca's complex and compromised life. It is impeccably researched, carefully structured, and written with admirable brio. For good or ill, ours is a Senecan age." --Simon Critchley, The New School for Social Research<p></p><br>"A fresh, perceptive, and in-depth look at the enigmatic Seneca, giving us a nuanced perspective into the conflicted mind and motives of the philosopher who embraced lofty Stoic ideals while serving Nero and amassing great wealth in the process. I honestly could not put it down, it is so insightful and well written and yes-suspenseful, even though we know the ending." --Margaret George, author of <em>Elizabeth I: The Novel and Helen of Troy: A Novel</em><p></p><br>"Unique as a scholarly book-length treatment of Seneca, this biography should appeal to anyone intrigued by the paradox of struggling to achieve wealth and power-and peace of mind." - Library Journal<p></p><br>"One way to sort out the contradictions of Seneca's life is not even to try. The art critic Robert Hughes labelled Seneca 'a hypocrite almost without equal in the ancient world', and left it at that. Romm and Wilson--and the new wave of Seneca scholars more generally--resist such reductive judgments. It is possible, in their view, to see Seneca as a hypocrite and as a force of moral restraint." --The New Yorker <br><p></p><br>"Seneca lived in a world where dissimulation was a way of life, and the confusion between reality and failure woven into the very fabric of the state. It is the mirror he holds up to it which makes him such a great and unsettling writer, and which Wilson's fine biography does so much to explicate." --<em>The Telegraph</em><p></p><br>"Since Miriam Griffin's <em>Seneca: A Philosopher in Politics</em> (1976), historians have wondered how Seneca could reconcile being a millionaire courtier and Nero's's adviser with his Stoic principles. For Wilson, the more interesting question is why he preached what he did, when he knew his integrity was so compromised. " --<em>The Guardian</em><p></p><br>"Wilson finds Seneca's life and work relevant to modern-day western culture, troubled by the psychological pressures that go with material wealth and by the problems attendant on consumerism and globalisation. By quoting in translation and explaining Roman practices she helps the general reader enjoy her well-written and imaginative book." --<em>History Today</em><p></p><br>"Morally our author is tough on Seneca, contrasting, for example, his lickspittle approach to Nero with Boudicca's resistance. But she is a persuasive extoller of his writing and the final chapter about his diverse legacy is breathtaking." --<em>The Spectator</em><p></p><br>"...the most famous and poignant example of a philosopher trying and spectacularly failing to improve a ruler, is that of the Roman Stoic Seneca, whose life is wonderfully retold here by the classicist Emily Wilson." --<em>The Sunday Times</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Evaluation of Health Care Quality for DNPs, Second Edition&#x2013;Doctor of Nursing PracticeGraduates&#x2019; Award-Winning Text</h2><p><p>First Edition Received 100 Points and 5-Star Doody&#x201a;��s Review! </p> <p>This is the only nursing text to facilitate the achievement by Doctor of Nursing Practice graduates (DNPs) s of the highest possible competency inconducting systematic and in-depth evaluations of all aspects of health care.

No one philosopher contributed more to this enterprise than Kant, whose Critique of Pure Reason (1781) shook the very foundations of the intellectual world. Kant argued that the basic principles of the natural sciences are imposed on reality by human sensibility and understanding, and thus that human beings are also free to impose their own free and rational agency on the world. This volume is the only systematic and comprehensive account of the full range of Kant&#39;s writings available, and the first major overview of his work to be published in more than a dozen years. An internationally recognized team of Kant scholars explore Kant&#39;s conceptual revolution in epistemology, metaphysics, philosophy of science, moral and political philosophy, aesthetics, and the philosophy of religion. The volume also traces the historical origins and consequences of Kant&#39;s work.</p><p>An internationally recognized team of scholars explores Kant&#39;s conceptual revolution in epistemology, metaphysics, philosophy of science, moral and political philosophy, aesthetics, and the philosophy of religion.This is the third in a series of companions to major philosophers that Cambridge will be issuing in the next few years. Each volume will contain specially commissioned essays by an international team of scholars, together with a substantial bibliography and will serve as a reference work for students and nonspecialists. One aim of the series is to dispel the intimidation such readers often feel when faced with the work of a difficult and challenging thinker.</p><h2>The Lincoln-Douglas Debates of 1858</h2><p>To celebrate the 150th anniversary of the most famous political argument in U.S. history, <em>The Lincoln-Douglas Debates of 1858</em> is now available in a special commemorative edition. As Abraham Lincoln and Stephen A. Douglas fiercely competed for the Illinois seat in the U.S. Senate, they debated many of the crucial and controversial issues--including slavery--that would later come to define Lincoln's political career. Thoughtfully edited by acclaimed historian Robert W. Johannsen, this essential manuscript captures a groundbreaking and provocative moment in American politics.<br><br>Framed by an insightful new foreword by Johannsen's former student James L. Huston, this series of debates communicates the eloquence, urgency, and immediacy of its historical moment. To make these arguments more relevant to contemporary readers, Huston discusses the historiography of the debates since 1965, how various historians have addressed the debates, and why the debates remain so important today. This indispensable resource also includes Douglas's Chicago speech and Lincoln's "House Divided" speech. Providing a timely and engrossing look at this dynamic event, the 150th anniversary edition of <em>The Lincoln-Douglas Debates of 1858</em> remains the authoritative presentation of these lively, landmark orations.<br></p><p><br><strong>Robert W.

Called &#39;a sheep in sheep&#39;s clothing&#39;, his reputation has long been that of an unassuming character in the shadow of Churchill. But as John Bew&#39;s revelatory biography shows, Attlee was not only a hero of his age, but an emblem of it; and his life tells the story of how Britain changed over the twentieth century. Here, Bew pierces Attlee&#39;s reticence to examine the intellect and beliefs of Britain&#39;s greatest - and least appreciated - peacetime prime minister. This edition includes a new preface by the author in response to the 2017 general election.</p><p>John Bew teaches History and Foreign Policy at the War Studies Department at King&#39;s College London.

He was born in Belfast, educated at Cambridge, and lives in Wimbledon, London.John Bew&#39;s survey of Labour&#39;s post-war hero Clement Attlee resurrects the idea of the political biography almost thought lost: encyclopaedic, analytical, massive in scope but intimate in understanding. * Waterstones Weekly * Both a magnificent renewal of the art of political biography and a monument to the greatest leader the Labour party has ever had. It presents us with a man whose socialism was learned, not acquired * Jonathan Derbyshire, Judge of The Orwell Prize * Winner of the Elizabeth Longford Prize for Historical Biography His true political genius and unflinching moral purpose are brilliantly reappraised in John Bew&#39;s Citizen Clem . . . This book is a rare beast - political biography at its finest, yet one that is deeply moving -- David Bell * Times Literary Supplement * This is a big book in scope and depth and is a very good read besides. It is not just a political biography, but an explanation of the man, what made him, the roots of his patriotism, his military experience in the First World War, his love of literature . . . in a way Citizen Clem is a history of the twentieth century * Tablet * Bew is particularly good on the dynamics of his close relationship with Churchill . . . Bew&#39;s revelatory biography explains that achievement. But it also brings us a 3D, flesh and blood Citizen Clem, and boy, does he make him shine! -- Gordon Marsden * Times Higher Education * The best book in the field of British politics. Book of the Year. -- Philip Collins * The Times * Bew has the detachment of a professional historian, but an understanding of politics and personalities. Book of the Year -- Kwasi Kwarteng * Evening Standard * The author sets out to claim a place among the greats for his subject and succeeds . . . The lessons for modern politics are made clearly. Book of the Year -- Daniel Finkelstein * The Times * Attlee was a distant and austere figure by reputation, but the book sweeps that away from the start, recalling Clem the street agitator and war hero. Book of the Year -- Roland White * Sunday Times * A masterful portrait of a man who led the Labour Party for 20 years and arguably did more than any other UK politician to shape the postwar world . . . Attlee was a patriot who believed that tolerance was Britain&#39;s greatest gift to the world. Now, more than ever, it is tolerance we need. Book of the Year -- Tom Watson * New Statesman * Read this book to understand what Labour once was and what has been lost because of its embrace of identity politics and ultra-liberalism. Book of the Year -- Jason Cowley * New Statesman * Magisterial . . . A great work of personal biography, social history, political philosophy, international relations and ferrets-in-a-sack Labour Party infighting . . . Bew explores in great detail Attlee&#39;s pilgrim&#39;s progress toward socialism with a thorough critique of his literary, cultural and political reading. . . As the Labour Party retreats towards ideological self-immolation, as Britain stumbles on the world stage, and as European social democracy stands in peril, we need another Attlee more than ever. In the absence of which, we have Bew&#39;s brilliant book -- Tristram Hunt * Prospect * An absorbing new life of Clement Attlee shows how a quiet man from the suburbs became Labour&#39;s unlikely postwar hero . . . So how did a man who was the object of so much private derision by his peers come to preside over Labour&#39;s greatest (some might say only) radical government? Bew puts the question at the core of his story. He answers it convincingly by mixing arresting narrative with a thorough study of the people and policies of the Labour movement at a time of hardship interspersed by war and fierce ideological difference . . . The book is replete with amusing vignettes . . . This book will become required reading for the present-day Labour party -- John Kampfner * Observer * Outstanding . . . This excellent new life of Labour&#39;s greatest leader . . . We still live in the society that was shaped by Clement Attlee . . . Bew&#39;s achievement is not only to bring this curious and introverted man to life, but to make him oddly loveable. He steps out like a character from the pages of the social novels of H. G. Wells or George Orwell . . . To read this book in the shadow of the present Labour leadership election is a salutary experience -- Robert Harris * Sunday Times * This biography makes a strong case for Attlee&#39;s greatness . . . Such contradictions deserve a discerning biographer, and in John Bew, Attlee has the man he deserves. He has written with verve and confidence a first-rate life of a man whom he correctly argues has been under-appreciated . . . What a life and what a man -- Daniel Finkelstein * The Times * Fascinating . . . He writes with flair and considerable intellectual confidence . . . Bew believes that Labour has lost a sense of historical mission . . . This insight seems right to me -- Jason Cowley * Financial Times * In this monumental biography, John Bew sets out to explore, not just the scale of the achievement, but to discover what made Attlee tick . . . A good book about a remarkable man -- Chris Mullin * Guardian * The brilliant young historian John Bew urges Labour to recapture something of the ethos of the Attlee period * Telegraph * If Labour is to return to power, it is not to Tony Blair and Harold Wilson to whom it should turn for inspiration but to the ethos and example of Attlee . . . Citizen Clem promises to be one of the highlights of the autumn season -- Jason Cowley * New Statesman * Easily the best single-volume, cradle-to-grave life of Clement Attlee yet written. Professor Bew updates but also betters all the other biographies with this intelligent, well-researched and highly readable book. Scholarly and perceptive, it tells the story of how quiet determination and impeccable political timing wrought a peaceful revolution * Andrew Roberts * Winner of The Orwell Prize for Political Writing</p><h2>How to Walk Away: A Novel</h2><p><p><b>From the author of <i>Happiness for Beginner</i>s comes the instant <i>New York Times</i> bestseller (May 2018), an unforgettable love story about finding joy even in the darkest of circumstances. </b></p><p>Margaret Jacobsen is just about to step into the bright future she&#x2019;s worked for so hard and so long: a new dream job, a fianc� she adores, and the promise of a picture-perfect life just around the corner.

Four young Piedmontese women&#x2014;Ada, Frida, Silvia and Bianca&#x2014;living secretly in the mountains surrounding Turin, risked their lives to overthrow Italy&#x2019;s authoritarian government. They were among the thousands of Italians who joined the Partisan effort to help the Allies liberate their country from the German invaders and their Fascist collaborators. What made this partisan war all the more extraordinary was the number of women&#x2014;like this brave quartet&#x2014;who swelled its ranks.</p><p>The bloody civil war that ensued pitted neighbor against neighbor, and revealed the best and worst in Italian society. The courage shown by the partisans was exemplary, and eventually bound them together into a coherent fighting force.

The significance of scripture may not be immediately obvious in our secular world, but its misunderstanding is perhaps the root cause of many of today's controversies.</b><br><br>In this timely and important book, one of the most trusted and admired writers on the world of faith examines the meaning of scripture. The sacred texts have been coopted by fundamentalists, who insist that they must be taken literally, and by others who interpret scripture to bolster their own prejudices. These texts are seen to prescribe ethical norms and codes of behavior that are divinely ordained: they are believed to contain eternal truths. But as Karen Armstrong shows in this chronicle of the development and significance of major religions, such a narrow, peculiar reading of scripture is a relatively recent, modern phenomenon. For most of their history, the world's religious traditions have regarded these texts as tools that enable the individual to connect with the divine, to experience a different level of consciousness, and to help them engage with the world in more meaningful and compassionate ways.<br><br>At a time of intolerance and mutual incomprehension, <i>The Lost Art of Scripture</i> shines fresh light on the world's major religions to help us build bridges between faiths and rediscover a creative and spiritual engagement with holy texts.</p><p>KAREN ARMSTRONG is the author of numerous books on religious affairs, including&nbsp;<i>The Case for God, A History of God, The Battle for God, Holy War, Islam, Buddha,</i>and&nbsp;<i>The Great Transformation</i>, as well as a memoir,&nbsp;<i>The Spiral Staircase.</i>&nbsp;Her work has been translated into forty-five languages.

Yahweh, the divine creator, placed the first human beings in Eden, where there was &#x201c;every kind of tree, enticing to look at and good to eat, with the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil in the middle of the garden.&#x201d; But Yahweh gave Adam a stern warning: he could eat the fruit of all these trees except the fruit of the tree of knowledge, &#x201c;for on the day you eat of it, you shall most surely die.&#x201d; But, alas, Eve succumbed to the temptation of the serpent, and she and Adam were condemned to a life of hard labour and suffering that could end only in death.<br><br> This story is so deeply embedded in the Judaeo-Christian consciousness that it is, perhaps, surprising to learn that in fact it is steeped in the Mesopotamian Wisdom traditions that embodied the ethical ideals that bound the ruling aristocracy together. Civilisation began in Sumer, in what is now Iraq, in about 3500 bce. The Sumerians were the first to commandeer the agricultural surplus grown by the community in the fertile plain that lay between the rivers Tigris and Euphrates and create a privileged ruling class. By about 3000 bce, there were twelve cities in the Mesopotamian plain, each supported by produce grown by peasants in the surrounding countryside. The Sumerian aristocrats and their retainers&#x2014;bureaucrats, soldiers, scribes, merchants and household servants&#x2014;appropriated between half and two-thirds of the crop grown by the peasants, who were reduced to serfdom. They left fragmentary records of their misery: &#x201c;The poor man is better dead than alive,&#x201d; one lamented. Sumer had devised the system of structural inequity that would prevail in every single state until the modern period, when agriculture ceased to be the economic basis of civilisation.<br><br> Adam and Eve, however, lived at the beginning of time, before the earth yielded brambles and thistles and humans had to wrest their food from the recalcitrant soil with sweat on their brow. Their life in Eden was idyllic until Eve met the serpent, who is described as arum, the most &#x201c;subtle,&#x201d; &#x201c;shrewd&#x201d; and &#x201c;wise&#x201d; of the animals. &#x201c;Did God really say you were not to eat from any of the trees in the garden?&#x201d; the serpent asked her. Eve replied that only the tree of knowledge was prohibited on pain of instant death. The arum serpent&#x2019;s prediction of what would happen to Adam and Eve drew heavily on the terminology of Sumerian Wisdom: &#x201c;No! You will not die! God knows in fact that on the day you eat it your eyes will be opened and you will be like gods, knowing good and evil.&#x201d; Of course, Eve succumbed: she wanted to transcend her humanity and become godlike. The couple did not, in fact, die as soon as they ate the forbidden fruit, as Yahweh had threatened. Instead, as the serpent promised, &#x201c;the eyes of both were opened&#x201d;&#x2014;words that recall the exclamation of a Mesopotamian student to his teacher:<br><br> Master-god, who [shapes] humanity, you are my god!<br><br> You have opened my eyes as if I were a puppy;<br><br> You have formed humanity within me!<br><br> For this student, &#x201c;divinity&#x201d; was not &#x201c;supernatural&#x201d; but an enhancement of his uncivilised and, therefore, subhuman nature. But their knowledge of good and evil made Adam and Eve ashamed of their naked, raw humanity, so &#x201c;Yahweh God made clothes of skins for the man and his wife, and they put them on&#x201d;&#x2014;a reversal of an incident in the Mesopotamian Epic of Gilgamesh, when Enkidu, primal man, attains full humanity only when he dons the clothes required by civilised life.<br><br> The biblical author is drawing on these Mesopotamian motifs in a distinctive, perhaps ironic way, but this narrative, placed at the very beginning of the Bible, makes it clear that scripture does not fall directly from heaven but is a human artefact, rooted in the presuppositions of a culture shared with people who are not blessed with divine revelation. This enigmatic tale also shows that scripture does not always yield clear, unequivocal teaching, but often leaves us puzzled and unmoored. In the first chapter of the Bible, God had repeatedly pronounced the whole of creation to be &#x201c;good,&#x201d; yet we are specifically told that the serpent, who urges Eve to disobey, is part of God&#x2019;s creation. Did the potential for lawlessness and rebellion lie at the root of being&#x2014;and is it, therefore, &#x201c;good&#x201d;? And why was Yahweh economical with the truth, telling Adam that he would die on the very day he ate the forbidden fruit? The biblical author does not answer these questions, and we will see that Jews and Christians would interpret this puzzling story in strikingly different ways.<br><br> This is not an isolated instance of Mesopotamian influence in Hebrew scripture. There are, for example, obvious parallels between Mesopotamian and Israelite legal and treaty traditions. The epic literature of both peoples refers to a Great Flood that inundated the entire world in primordial times; and the story of Moses, whose mother hid him from Pharaoh&#x2019;s officials in the bulrushes, closely resembles the legend of Sargon, who, in the third millennium bce, ruled the first agrarian empire, in what is now Iraq, Iran, Syria and Lebanon. More importantly, the preoccupation with social justice and equity, which would be essential to the monotheistic scriptures of Judaism, Christianity and Islam, was neither peculiar to Israel nor the result of a special divine revelation. Even though the agrarian economy depended upon the suppression of ninety per cent of the population, the protection of the weak and vulnerable was a common preoccupation in the ancient Near East. The Sumerian kings had insisted that justice for the poor, the orphan and the widow was a sacred duty decreed by the sun god Shamash, who listened attentively to their cries for help. Later, the Code of King Hammurabi (r. 1728&#x2013;1686 bce), who founded the Babylonian empire in Mesopotamia, decreed that the sun would shine over the people only if the king and his aristocracy did not oppress their subjects; in Egypt, Pharaoh must be just to his subjects because Re, the sun god, was the &#x201c;vizier of the poor.&#x201d; This reflected a nagging discomfort with the inherent injustice of the agrarian state and was also, perhaps, an attempt to distinguish the &#x201c;merciful&#x201d; king from the officials who implemented it. There seemed to be no solution to the moral dilemma of civilisation. In the Epic of Gilgamesh, the common people complain of their king&#x2019;s cruelty, but when the gods put their case to Anu, the high god, he shakes his head sadly yet cannot change this chronically inequitable system.<br><br> Adam and Eve had violated a formal agreement with Yahweh; this too was an expression of a widespread Middle Eastern fear of breaking a sacred contract. It was the &#x201c;original sin.&#x201d; The theme of a divine covenant, which would dominate the Hebrew Bible, pervaded the ancient Near East from the second half of the second millennium bce. The scribes of Egypt had also created a curriculum to enculturate elite youth in the ideology that would bind their society together and give it a distinctive ethos. Egyptians called this &#x201c;Maat,&#x201d; meaning &#x201c;truth, fairness, justice.&#x201d; It required an individual to think of others and adhere to what is often called the Golden Rule, which demands that we treat others as we wish to be treated ourselves&#x2014;though this, of course, did not apply to the peasants toiling in the fields.<br><br> But Maat did not come naturally to human beings. It had to be cultivated by what has been called &#x201c;cultural memory,&#x201d; which consisted of a body of recollections, stories of the past and visions for the future that created a communal consciousness. To form a cohesive society, individuals deliberately cultivated this memory, designing rituals that enabled them to keep it constantly in mind. In the ancient world, ideal norms were usually traced back to the very distant past and embodied in such outstanding individuals as Gilgamesh, the ancient Sumerian king whose deeds were celebrated in the great Mesopotamian epic. This was not an exercise in nostalgia but a call to action: an ideal that had been realised once could be achieved again. The past was, therefore, a realisable &#x201c;present,&#x201d; a project for each generation. In Mesopotamia, Phoenicia and Egypt, aristocratic youths were enculturated in an educative process that inscribed core texts, such as the Epic of Gilgamesh, together with proverbs, hymns, important historical treaties and tales of the beginning of time, in their minds and hearts.<br><br> Although these key texts were written down, they had first to be deeply etched into the psyche of the ruling class, who were in charge of the precarious agrarian economy. Our word &#x201c;scripture&#x201d; implies a written text, and since the invention of printing, literacy has become widespread, even common, and reading a silent, solitary activity. But in the ancient world, manuscripts were often heavy, unwieldy and almost illegible; the oldest Greek manuscripts, for example, were all written in capitals with no spaces between the words. In Mesopotamia, cuneiform clay tablets were often so small that they would have been extremely difficult to decipher. They were not designed to provide an initial reading, but functioned like a musical score for a performer who already knows the piece. It was taken for granted that a reader perusing the text of the Epic of Gilgamesh or Homer&#x2019;s Iliad already knew it by heart. A written version could only provide a permanent point of reference for the memorisation and transmission of those texts that were integral to society. Students did not memorise a text from a manuscript, therefore; instead it was recited, chanted or sung to them until they could recite it verbatim.<br><br> In Mesopotamia and Egypt, the cultural tradition was preserved in the minds and hearts of the scribes who held society together and had &#x201c;libraries in their heads.&#x201d; As students, they had been required to recite these key texts with impeccable accuracy so that they could convey them punctiliously to the next generation: &#x201c;You are of course a skilled scribe at the head of your fellows,&#x201d; we read in an ancient Egyptian satire, &#x201c;and the teaching of every book is inscribed in your head.&#x201d; Scribal schools were usually small and family-based. A father would instruct his son in the Wisdom traditions but, because of the high level of mortality, he also took other pupils. The aim was not to impart facts, but rather to drill the values of the ruling class into the student&#x2019;s mind until he embodied the ethos that permeated society. He then became a &#x201c;civilised&#x201d; human being. A Mesopotamian riddle describes the function of the scribal school:<br><br> With closed eyes one enters it,<br><br> With opened eyes one comes out.<br><br> Students, as we have seen, regarded their teachers as &#x201c;gods,&#x201d; who had enabled them to gain &#x201c;humanity.&#x201d; This did not imply that their education had made them compassionate and humane. Unlike the peasant masses who were regarded as an inferior species, only those students who had been fully enculturated in the Sumerian aristocratic ethos were regarded as fully human. Students were not educated to think for themselves; the survival of the precarious Sumerian civilisation demanded total and unquestioning conformity with the mores of the ruling class, which had to become second nature to each young aristocrat and scribal retainer. This so-called humanity was embodied most fully in the person of the king, who was revered as the pre-eminent sage.<br><br> Writing was, therefore, associated with power and coercion. The cuneiform script was initially developed to record the taxes extorted from the peasantry. It furthered the project of political subjugation and centralisation. Writing enabled a government to communicate at a distance; it was useful in commerce, state transactions and legal affairs. But no state had either the resources or, indeed, the incentive to make the public literate. For centuries, long after the invention of writing, the oral transmission of tradition remained the norm. Scribes were required to transform the unschooled student into an &#x201c;insider&#x201d; in a numbing indoctrination that turned him into a docile, obedient subject. Learning was usually enforced by corporal punishment and the students&#x2019; minds were broken by the stultifying experience of memorising texts that imparted obsolete, boring and seemingly irrelevant information in ancient Sumerian, a language which over time became so arcane that it was well-nigh incomprehensible.<br><br> But this gruelling regime did not always stunt creativity. An especially gifted scribe would sometimes be required to address current preoccupations by transforming and adapting the ancient traditions. He was even allowed to insert new material into the stories and Wisdom literature of the past. This introduces us to an important theme in the history of scripture. Today we tend to regard a scriptural canon as irrevocably closed and its texts sacrosanct, but we shall find that in all cultures, scripture was essentially a work in progress, constantly changing to meet new conditions. This was certainly the case in ancient Mesopotamia. An exceptionally advanced scribe was allowed&#x2014;indeed expected&#x2014;to improvise, and this enabled Mesopotamian culture to survive the demise of the original Sumerian dynasties and inform the later Akkadian and Babylonian regimes by grafting the new onto the old. The Enuma Elish, an ancient Sumerian creation hymn, was adapted to culminate in the founding of Babylon by Hammurabi. Later, scribes composed a version of the hymn that climaxed in Akkad, Sargon&#x2019;s capital. They also added material that transformed the Gilgamesh epic into an Akkadian text, while the Akkadian epic celebrating Sargon&#x2019;s career drew freely on ancient Sumerian tales. The scribes were not merely &#x201c;citing&#x201d; earlier works, nor was this a &#x201c;cut and paste&#x201d; operation. They had memorised these texts so thoroughly that they had become building blocks of their thinking process; like jazz musicians, they were improvising with material that had become integral to their very being and devising new texts that spoke directly to the present.<br><br> Egypt tended to specialise in Wisdom texts that promoted Maat. Here too, the aim was to create a cohesive society by preventing the ruling class from advancing their own interests at the expense of others. Egyptian Wisdom linked success to virtuous conduct, and punishment to transgression. As in Mesopotamia, the education of the elite involved the memorisation and recitation of texts, which seem to have been set to music, and were chanted or sung. Constantly, the scribe urged his students to &#x201c;listen&#x201d; to these beautifully composed maxims, to take them &#x201c;to heart&#x201d; and experience them viscerally. The &#x201c;Instructions of Amenemope,&#x201d; which were reproduced in the Hebrew Bible, gives us the flavour of these oral teachings that insistently promoted Maat:<br><br> Give ear to my words<br><br> and apply your heart to knowing them;<br><br> For it will be a delight to keep them deep within you<br> to have them all ready on your lips.<br> So that your trust may be in Yahweh,<br> today I propose to make your way known to you . . . Because a man is poor, do not therefore cheat him,<br> nor at the city gate, oppress anybody in affliction; For Yahweh takes up their cause,<br> and extorts the life of their extortioners.<br> Make friends with no man who gives way to anger,<br> make no hasty- tempered man a companion of yours.<br> During the sixteenth century bce, Bedouin tribesmen, whom the Egyptians called Hyksos (&#x201c;chieftains from foreign lands&#x201d;), man-aged to establish their own dynasty in the delta area. The Egyptians eventually expelled them, but after this experience, Egypt, hitherto a relatively peaceable agrarian state, became more militan...</p><h2>Shadow Work (Open Forum Series)</h2><p>Shadow Work describes how professionals have taken over things people used to do for themselves - even learning their own language.</p><p>Ivan Illich is the author of Celebration of Awareness, Tools for Conviviality, The Right to Useful Unemployment, Energy and Equity, Limits to Medicine, Shadow Work, Gender, H2O and the Waters of Forgetfulness, ABC: The Alphabetization of the Popular Mind, Disabling Professions, Deschooling Society and In the Mirror of the Past: Lectures and Addresses 1978-1990.</p><h2>The Prince (Penguin Great Ideas)</h2><p>Rejecting the traditional values of political theory, Machiavelli drew upon his own experiences of office in the turbulent Florentine republic to write his celebrated treatise on statecraft.

The person who held the aforementioned office with the tongue-twisting title was none other than Niccol� Machiavelli, who, suddenly finding himself out of a job after 14 years of patriotic service, followed the career trajectory of many modern politicians into punditry. Unable to become an on-air political analyst for a television network, he only wrote a book. But what a book <i>The Prince</i> is. Its essential contribution to modern political thought lies in Machiavelli's assertion of the then revolutionary idea that theological and moral imperatives have no place in the political arena. "It must be understood," Machiavelli avers, "that a prince ... cannot observe all of those virtues for which men are reputed good, because it is often necessary to act against mercy, against faith, against humanity, against frankness, against religion, in order to preserve the state." With just a little imagination, readers can discern parallels between a 16th-century principality and a 20th-century presidency. <i>--Tim Hogan</i>Here is the world's most famous master plan for seizing and holding power. Astonishing in its candor <i>The Prince</i> even today remains a disturbingly realistic and prophetic work on what it takes to be a prince . . . a king . . . a president. When, in 1512, Machiavelli was removed from his post in his beloved Florence, he resolved to set down a treatise on leadership that was practical, not idealistic. In <i>The Prince</i> he envisioned would be unencumbered by ordinary ethical and moral values; his prince would be man and beast, fox and lion. Today, this small sixteenth-century masterpiece has become essential reading for every student of government, and is the ultimate book on power politics.</p><h2>The Stitching Hour (Embroidery Mystery)</h2><p><b>In the latest mystery from the bestselling author of Wicked Stitch, the future of Marcy Singer&#x2019;s embroidery shop is dangling by a thread...</b><br><br>Marcy&#x2019;s shop, the Seven-Year Stitch, is one year old this October so it&#x2019;s time to party in little Tallulah Falls, Oregon.

At only two years old, he still had a lot of puppy in him, but he was mannerly and well behaved. The patrons of my embroidery shop, the Seven-Year Stitch, loved him.</p><p>&#x201c;Can you believe we&#x2019;ve been here in Tallulah Falls for almost a year?&#x201d; I asked him. I jerked my head in the direction of Jill, the mannequin-slash-Marilyn-Monroe-lookalike that stood by the cash register. &#x201c;Jill says she can&#x2019;t.&#x201d; I looked at her, as if she&#x2019;d actually said something. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s that, Jill? What you can&#x2019;t believe is how I haven&#x2019;t dressed you in a beautiful new dress befitting the occasion?&#x201d; I blew out a breath. &#x201c;All in good time, Jill. All in good time.&#x201d;</p><p>Okay, so maybe having a mom who was a Hollywood costume designer led me to do more than my fair share of play-pretend as a child, and maybe&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. just <i>maybe</i>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that trait had followed me over into adulthood. But I got lonely when I was the only person in the store. And when the only &#x201c;people&#x201d; around to talk with were Angus and Jill, I made do. Besides, I was pretty sure that Angus not only understood every word I said but that he communicated with me too. He had such expressive eyes. And that smile! With Jill, you just had to make it all up as you went and hope she wasn&#x2019;t one of those cursed paranormal items that would come to life and try to kill you one day.</p><p>So on <i>that</i> creepy thought, I gazed around the store and firmly directed my thoughts back to my upcoming anniversary open house. Since it was October 1, Jill was wearing a witch costume. She wasn&#x2019;t scary&#x2014;she was more of a Samantha from <i>Bewitched</i> type. Before the open house, I planned to change her into either a white or pink dress&#x2014;more Marilyn than Sam.</p><p>Everything else in the store would probably be all right <i>as is</i>, other than tidying up and borrowing a few folding chairs from the library. Since I was good friends with the librarian, Rajani &#x201c;Reggie&#x201d; Singh, I didn&#x2019;t think that would be a problem. Under normal circumstances, I had plenty of seating in my sit-and-stitch square&#x2014;two navy sofas that faced each other across an oval maple coffee table, a red club chair at either end of the table, and ottomans matching the chairs. I wondered briefly if I should shampoo the red-and-blue braided rug that lay beneath the table, but I decided a thorough vacuuming would be fine.</p><p>I turned to the merchandise part of the store, where I&#x2019;d been marking down prices and placing specials on the shelf nearest the door. I looked over the embroidery projects that lined the walls with a critical eye. Should I add more? Take a few down? There was the redwork swan&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the Celtic cross&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the sampler I&#x2019;d made from Louisa Ralston&#x2019;s original&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the bunny done in crewelwork&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the Bollywood-inspired elephant&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the pirate map tapestry&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the cross-stitched bride.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. With a slight smile, I decided to leave them all. I didn&#x2019;t think it was necessary to add another one&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. yet&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but there weren&#x2019;t any I wanted to take down.</p><p>I went over to the sit-and-stitch square, moved aside one of the candlewick pillows, and plopped down on the navy sofa facing the storefront window. I&#x2019;d come a long way in the past year, professionally and personally. Just before I moved here, I&#x2019;d adopted Angus, and we were living in an apartment in San Francisco where I worked in an accounting office. Then Sadie MacKenzie had called and urged me to come to Tallulah Falls and open my own embroidery shop. Sadie had been my best friend and roommate in college. She and her husband, Blake, had a coffee shop called MacKenzies&#x2019; Mochas right down the street from the Stitch. She hadn&#x2019;t had to twist my arm; and despite my ups and downs in Tallulah Falls, I was happier here than I&#x2019;d ever been.</p><p>I&#x2019;d barely sat down when Vera Langhorne came through the door.</p><p>&#x201c;Good morning, Marcy,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>&#x201c;Hi,&#x201d; I said as Angus trotted over to greet Vera.</p><p>She scratched his head and cooed to him for a minute before joining me on the sofa. Vera had also come a long way in the year that I&#x2019;d known her. She was no longer the mousy brunette in baggy clothes that I&#x2019;d met when I&#x2019;d first arrived in Tallulah Falls. Now she wore her hair blond with subtle highlights, and she always dressed with style and class. Today she wore gray slacks, black pumps, and a royal blue short-sleeved sweater twinset.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll never believe what&#x2019;s coming in next door to you,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>&#x201c;Please tell me that whatever it is won&#x2019;t be operated by a relative of Nellie Davis,&#x201d; I said with a groan.</p><p>Nellie Davis owned the aromatherapy shop down the street, and she and I had never been friends. Heck, we&#x2019;d hardly been civil. I&#x2019;d tried over the past year to warm up our relationship, but Nellie was convinced that all the mishaps that had befallen Tallulah Falls had coincided with my arrival and that either I or my shop&#x2014;or both&#x2014;was cursed. She&#x2019;d been so antagonistic toward me that she&#x2019;d recently talked her sister, Clara, into renting the space next to the Seven-Year Stitch&#x2014;a knitting shop, no less, where she&#x2019;d also planned to sell embroidery supplies! Unfortunately, Clara had met with a bad end, and the shop was once again for lease. Well, not anymore, it seemed.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s gonna be a haunted house!&#x201d; Vera clapped her hands in excitement. &#x201c;Won&#x2019;t that be fun? They&#x2019;re only here for the month of October, but from what they told Paul, they plan to do it up right.&#x201d;</p><p>Vera was dating Paul Samms, a reporter for the <i>Tallulah Falls Examiner</i>.</p><p>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re going to take the first few days of the month to decorate and move in all their creepy crawly stuff, and the actual haunted house is going to open the following weekend,&#x201d; she continued.</p><p>I frowned. &#x201c;Are they only going to be open during the weekends? If so, how will they make enough to justify renting the building?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;According to Paul, after that opening weekend, they&#x2019;re going to be open every night,&#x201d; said Vera. &#x201c;So they believe&#x2014;and so do I&#x2014;that they&#x2019;ll make their rent back many times over. They&#x2019;ll have special events throughout the month to draw repeat business, like themed costume contests, local celebrities&#x2014;news anchors and people like that&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Paul might even be one. <i>And</i> they&#x2019;re having concessions!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re having concessions at a haunted house? That seems a little odd.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m surprised Sadie hasn&#x2019;t mentioned it to you. She and Blake are in charge of the food.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Neither of them has said a word to me,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;How will that work? I can&#x2019;t imagine where they&#x2019;ll find the time to run a concession stand on top of operating a busy coffee shop.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Paul says they&#x2019;re going to do fairly simple stuff&#x2014;caramel apples, popcorn and kettle corn, cookies, some hot chocolate and a couple of other beverages maybe&#x2014;and the patrons have to eat outside of the actual haunted house,&#x201d; said Vera. &#x201c;The haunted house operators don&#x2019;t want to wind up with a colossal mess. And one of the MacKenzies&#x2019; Mochas waitresses will work the haunted house each night. So it really shouldn&#x2019;t interfere with Sadie and Blake&#x2019;s schedules all that much.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Cool.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t look like you really feel that it&#x2019;s all that cool,&#x201d; Vera said. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m just concerned about how it will affect my evening classes,&#x201d; I told her. &#x201c;Some of my students are a little older&#x2014;like Muriel&#x2014;and I wouldn&#x2019;t want her to be frightened or put off if she hears a ton of screaming going on next door.&#x201d;</p><p>Vera laughed. &#x201c;Sweetie, you know Muriel can&#x2019;t hear herself think. And I don&#x2019;t know that it&#x2019;ll be <i>that </i>disruptive. Maybe you could put on some music or something.&#x201d;</p><p><i>Oh, sure,</i> I thought. <i>That would be great&#x2014;blaring music to drown out the screaming teenagers next door</i>.</p><p>&#x201c;Besides, you might enjoy going to the haunted house with Ted.&#x201d; Vera winked.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not saying it won&#x2019;t be fun,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I guess I&#x2019;m just being selfish. How will this affect me&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Angus&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. my students&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. my open house?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s right! Your anniversary&#x2019;s coming up!&#x201d; Vera clasped her hands together. &#x201c;What are we doing for that?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I thought I&#x2019;d have special sales and markdowns for the two weeks leading up to the open house. And I want to have gift bags for open house attendees.&#x201d; I leaned forward. &#x201c;But I&#x2019;m struggling with what to put into the bags. Any suggestions?&#x201d;</p><p>Vera looked up at the ceiling. &#x201c;Well&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you could put something different into every bag&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. like a coupon. Each coupon would be for a different amount off a particular item or the customer&#x2019;s entire purchase. And you could have <i>one</i> coupon for a free item within a particular price range.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s a fantastic idea,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>She smiled at me. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t sound so surprised, darling.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not surprised.&#x201d; I laughed. &#x201c;Honest. I&#x2019;ve simply been pondering over what I can give out that will appeal to everyone and not break the bank. The coupons are a wonderful idea.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sure,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;And you can put candies&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. teeny little sewing kits&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. maybe those braided friendship bracelets the kids like.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You have a ton of fantastic ideas, Vera Langhorne! You should be an event planner.&#x201d;</p><p>Vera laughed. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll take that under advisement.&#x201d;</p><p>Just then, Reggie hurried into the shop. Although she was beautifully dressed in an Indian-style coral tunic with matching slacks, Reggie&#x2019;s normally elegantly coifed short gray hair looked as if she&#x2019;d barely taken time to brush it this morning.</p><p>&#x201c;Have you heard?&#x201d; she asked us. &#x201c;Somebody&#x2019;s doing a haunted house next to your shop, Marcy!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s what Vera was telling me,&#x201d; I said, my smile fading. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m getting the feeling you&#x2019;re not in favor of haunted houses?&#x201d;</p><p>She dropped onto the sofa across from Vera and me. Angus came and placed his head on the arm of the sofa closest to Reggie. She patted his head absently.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m in favor of the <i>library&#x2019;s </i>haunted house,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s one of our biggest annual fund-raisers. And now this fancy group is going to come in and ruin it for us.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, they won&#x2019;t,&#x201d; Vera said. &#x201c;Their haunted house isn&#x2019;t geared for small children. It&#x2019;s more for teens and adults. Paul interviewed the event organizers, and they told him all about it. Your haunted house is supposed to be funny and sweet. Theirs is supposed to be scary as heck!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You truly don&#x2019;t think their haunted house will have an impact on our fund-raiser?&#x201d; Reggie asked.</p><p>&#x201c;I know it won&#x2019;t,&#x201d; Vera said. &#x201c;In fact, I&#x2019;ll insist that Paul give the library equal time. I&#x2019;ll see when he can drop in at the library and do a story on<i> your</i> haunted house. I&#x2019;ll make sure he emphasizes the importance of the fund-raiser on the library&#x2019;s annual budget. How does that sound?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That sounds terrific, Vera. Thank you.&#x201d; Reggie smoothed her hair. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry that I allowed the news of the new haunted house to upset me so badly. It isn&#x2019;t like me at all.&#x201d; She turned to me. &#x201c;How do <i>you</i> feel about having a fun house right next door, Marcy?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not terribly happy about it,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m afraid it&#x2019;ll drive Angus and my students crazy.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She was particularly concerned about the effect all the screaming might have on poor Muriel,&#x201d; Vera said. &#x201c;I told her Muriel probably wouldn&#x2019;t even notice, no better than she can hear.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;True, but I see Marcy&#x2019;s point,&#x201d; said Reggie. &#x201c;At least, they won&#x2019;t be disturbing your business during daylight hours.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s true,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;And it&#x2019;s only for a month. What real harm can it do?&#x201d;</p><p><i>When would I ever learn to stop asking that question?</i></p><p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�</p><p>My sweetheart, Ted, came for lunch. Ted was the head detective for the Tallulah Falls Police Department. He worked for Reggie&#x2019;s husband, Manu, who was the Chief of Police.</p><p>Broad, strong, and well over a foot taller than me, Ted was a walking dream. He had black hair with a few flecks of premature gray and the bluest eyes I&#x2019;d ever seen. He wore suits for work, and he favored gray and navy. Today he wore light gray with a royal blue shirt and a blue, gray, and lavender striped tie. He looked yummy.</p><p>On top of looking so mouth-watering, he brought my favorite lunch&#x2014;chicken salad croissants from MacKenzies&#x2019; Mochas. I had bottled water in the minifridge in my office. I didn&#x2019;t have a customer in the shop when Ted arrived, so I put the cardboard clock on the door, indicating that I&#x2019;d be back in half an hour so we could go into the office and eat undisturbed.</p><p>After we kissed hello, I got us each a bottle of water, and we sat at my desk to eat.</p><p>&#x201c;How&#x2019;s your day going?&#x201d; I asked, as I opened the box containing my croissant.</p><p>&#x201c;Fine. I&#x2019;m guessing you&#x2019;ve heard the news about the Horror Emporium that&#x2019;s moving in next door to you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Is that what they&#x2019;re calling it?&#x201d; I frowned. &#x201c;That seems like a mouthful&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. especially for kids.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, from what I hear, the Horror Emporium isn&#x2019;t designed for children. It&#x2019;s more for adults,&#x201d; said Ted. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve even heard that they plan to make visitors sign waivers before they buy their tickets, saying that if they&#x2019;re harmed in any way, suffer a heart attack or seizure, that the Horror Emporium will not be held responsible.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Good grief! What&#x2019;re they planning on doing in there?&#x201d;</p><p>He shrugged. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d say the waiver is more for publicity than anything. All the tough kids will want to come to prove they can&#x2019;t be scared by whatever some local haunted house can dish out.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I suppose.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; I uncapped my water bottle and took a drink.</p><p>&#x201c;You wanna go?&#x201d;</p><p>I grinned. &#x201c;Of course! Do you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They can&#x2019;t scare me.&#x201d; He winked. &#x201c;But I&#x2019;ll go with you so you&#x2019;ll have someone to hold on to.&#x201d;</p><p>I batted my eyelashes at him. &#x201c;My big strong hero!&#x201d;</p><p>He leaned across the desk to give me another kiss. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve missed you today.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But we had breakfast together this morning.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. four and a half hours ago.&#x201d; He tore off a piece of his croissant and tossed it to Angus, who caught it in midair. &#x201c;Good boy!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;About this haunted house,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Do you think they&#x2019;ll cause a lot of ruckus?&#x201d;</p><p>Ted grinned. &#x201c;Why, Ms. Singer, the Tallulah Falls Police Department will do our dead-level best to keep all the hoodlums at bay.&#x201d;</p><p>I rolled my eyes. &#x201c;I guess I did sound like a grumpy old lady, didn&#x2019;t I?&#x201d;</p><p>Angus drank noisily from his water bowl.</p><p>&#x201c;Maybe a little,&#x201d; said Ted. &#x201c;But, seriously, I can see your point. It would be ideal if this Horror Emporium wasn&#x2019;t right in the middle of Main Street. It&#x2019;s going to be hard for you and your students to concentrate during evening classes while crowds of people scream next door. I&#x2019;ll check to see if they&#x2019;re doing anything to help muffle the sound.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thank you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Just everyday hero stuff, ma&#x2019;am,&#x201d; he said. He bit into his sandwich as Angus sat near him expectantly.</p><p>I tossed Angus a bit of my croissant to give Ted a break. &#x201c;Vera was in earlier. She&#x2019;s the one who told me about the haunted house, by the way....</p></p><h2>Everyday Paleo Family Cookbook: Real Food for Real Life</h2><p>The <i>Everyday Paleo Family Cookbook</i> offers guidance on how to bring your family together with the magic of real food.

Yet he still finds himself devastated by the long-ago death of a promising student named Willow Briggs. Salome worked with and consistently encouraged this troubled boy, who ultimately became one of the school's top chess players and students. But when Willow moved on to high school, he found no real positive influences. He struggled academically and was murdered on a street corner at the age of sixteen. More than any other factor, Willow's death launched Salome Thomas-EL on his mission to be a positive influence, and to encourage all of us to set the best example possible for the young people in our lives. <br><br> <i>The Immortality of Influence</i> is a refreshing, common-sense roadmap to helping kids achieve their dreams in which Thomas-EL movingly describes the methods he has used to help his students succeed. It all started in Vaux Middle School, where he began a chess club to teach boys and girls how to think critically and resolve conflicts with their minds instead of their fists. Not only did his students win eight national championships and become local heroes, they also scored high on the SATs and got into top colleges. When Thomas-EL found himself faced with kids who didn't exercise or eat well, he started a summer program in which the students walked to museums and other cultural events around the city. Recognizing the importance of exposing kids to the world outside their own neighborhoods, he took fifteen African-American students to rural Vermont, where they interacted with white children their age and discovered how much they had in common. All of these students were later accepted to the best magnet high schools. These are just a few examples of what can happen when kids are mentored in a positive way--not only at home, but in the community at large. <br><br> For parents, guardians, educators--anyone who wants the best for kids, this book is an essential, inspirational reference. It's all about making a difference--not just for today, but forever. Sometimes, it only takes one special person to set a child on the right path, but more often, it does indeed take a village. <i>The Immortality of Influence</i> will inspire you to band together with other caring adults and start making a difference--now.</p><p><b>Salome Thomas-EL</b> is a national education expert, media consultant, and former award-winning teacher and principal in Philadelphia.

Anthropologist and archaeologist Betty Goerke has pieced together a portrait of the life of this Native American leader, using mission records, ethnographies, explorers' and missionaries' diaries and correspondence, and other material.</p></p><p>Betty Goerke has been teaching anthropology and archaeology at the College of Marin for over thirty years. She has conducted archaeological fieldwork in California, Colorado, Greece, Holland, Kenya, and India, and has authored books and articles and produced several videotapes, including Archaeology: Questioning the Past.The past 15 years or so have seen many important works on California Native Americans that are informed by sophisticated historical and anthropological sensibilities. Among them are books by M. Kat Anderson, Albert L. Hurtado, Robert H. Jackson, Kent G. Lightfoot, Randall Milliken, George Harwood Phillips, and James A. Sandos. This book is an accessible addition to this fresh wave of scholarship. Anthropologist Goerke (College of Marin) draws judiciously on meager archaeological, ethnographic, and archival evidence to construct what is as much a history of the Coast Miwok people as it is a biography of Marin (1781-1839). Born in a village of the Huimen tribe, Marin's birth name was Huicmuse. At Mission Dolores in 1801, Huicmuse was given the baptismal name of Marino. Marino/Marin became an alcalde and mayordomo at Mission San Rafael after its establishment in 1817. In 1821 he was a guide for a Spanish expedition to the north, but soon thereafter, as California transitioned from Spain to Mexico, he was written up as ''insubordinate.'' Californio Mariano Vallejo named Marin County for Marino in 1850; the remnants of the Coast Miwok, terminated 1958-70, received federal recognition in 2001 as part of the Federated Indians of Graton Rancheria.<br>Summing Up: Recommended. General collection/public libraries. -- D. F. Anderson, Northwestern College (IA) --CHOICE: CURRENT REVIEWS FOR ACADEMIC LIBRARIES April 2008<br><br>''As Betty Goerke sketches the life story of Chief Marin, she effectively remaps Marin and southern Sonoma counties, providing Indian and non-Indian alike a rich historical tapestry of the region's native people and their against-all-odds survival, a tapestry that has heretofore been ignored or forgotten.''<br> --From the foreword by Greg Sarris, Tribal Chair, Federated Indians of the Graton Rancheria<p> ''With meticulous research and lively prose, Betty Goerke tells the true story of one group of California Natives overwhelmed by a century of change, and of one of their chiefs, Marin, whose intelligence, skills, and independent spirit epitomized his people's yearning to be free.'' --Beth Ashley, <i>Marin Independent Journal</i></p></p><h2>Madame Bovary (Penguin Drop Caps)</h2><p><b>From A to Z, the Penguin Drop Caps series collects 26 unique hardcovers&#x2014;featuring cover art by type superstar Jessica Hische </b><br><br>It all begins with a letter.

Penguin Drop Caps debuts with an &#x201c;A&#x201d; for Jane Austen&#x2019;s <i>Pride and Prejudice</i>, a &#x201c;B&#x201d; for Charlotte Bront�&#x2019;s <i>Jane Eyre</i>, and a &#x201c;C&#x201d; for Willa Cather&#x2019;s <i>My �ntonia</i>, and continues with more classics from Penguin. <br><br><b>F is for Flaubert.</b> Emma Bovary is the original desperate housewife. Beautiful but bored, she is married to the provincial doctor Charles Bovary yet harbors dreams of an elegant and passionate life. Escaping into sentimental novels, she finds her fantasies dashed by the tedium of her days. Motherhood proves to be a burden; religion is only a brief distraction. In an effort to make her life everything she believes it should be, she spends lavishly on clothes and on her home and embarks on two disappointing affairs. Soon heartbroken and crippled by debts, Emma takes drastic action with tragic consequences for her husband and daughter. When published in 1857, <i>Madame Bovary</i> was deemed so lifelike that many women claimed they were the model for its heroine. Today the novel is considered the first masterpiece of realist fiction. In this landmark translation of Flaubert&#x2019;s masterwork, Lydia Davis honors the nuances and particulars of a style that has long beguiled readers of French, giving new life in English to the book that redefined the novel as an art form.</p><p>GUSTAVE FLAUBERT was born in Rouen in 1821, the son of a prominent physician. A solitary child, he was attracted to literature at an early age, and after his recovery from a nervous breakdown suffered while a law student, he turned his total energies to writing. Aside from journeys to the Near East, Greece, Italy, and North Africa, and a stormy liaison with the poetess Louise Colet, his life was dedicated to the practice of his art. The form of his work was marked by intense aesthetic scrupulousness and passionate pursuit of le mot juste; its content alternately reflected scorn for French bourgeois society and a romantic taste for exotic historical subject matter. The success of <i>Madame Bovary</i> (1857) was ensured by government prosecution for &#x201c;immorality&#x201d;; <i>Salammb� </i>(1862) and <i>The Sentimental Education</i> (1869) received a cool public reception; not until the publication of <i>Three Tales</i> (1877) was his genius popularly acknowledged. Among fellow writers, however, his reputation was supreme. His circle of friends included Turgenev and the Goncourt brothers, while the young Guy de Maupassant underwent an arduous literary apprenticeship under his direction. Increasing personal isolation and financial insecurity troubled his last years. His final bitterness and disillusion were vividly evidenced in the savagely satiric Bouvard and P�cuchet, left unfinished at his death in 1880.<br><br>LYDIA DAVIS has been a MacArthur Fellow, National Book Award finalist, and Chevalier of the Order of Arts and Letters. She was awarded the 2003 French-American Foundation Translation Prize for her translation of Marcel Proust's <i>Swann's Way</i> and lives near Albany, New York.<br><br>JESSICA HISCHE is a letterer, illustrator, typographer, and web designer.

The sleepers aroused themselves, and we all stood up, putting on a startled look, as if we had been buried in our work.<br><br>The Head motioned to us to sit down.<br><br>'Monsieur Roger,' said he in a quiet tone to the prep master, I've brought you a new boy. He's going into the second. If his conduct and progress are satisfactory, he will be put up with the boys of his own age. '<br><br>The new boy had kept in the background, in the corner behind the door, almost out of sight. He was a country lad of about fifteen, and taller than any of us. His hair was clipped straight across the forehead, like a village choirboy's. He seemed a decent enough fellow, but horribly nervous. Although he was not broad across the shoulders, his green cloth jacket, with its black buttons, looked as if it pinched him under the arms and revealed, protruding well beyond the cuffs, a pair of raw, bony wrists, obviously not unaccustomed to exposure. His legs, encased in blue stockings, issued from a pair of drab-coloured breeches, very tightly braced. He had on a pair of thick, clumsy shoes, not particularly well cleaned and plentifully fortified with nails.<br><br>The master began to hear the boys at their work. The newcomer listened with all his ears, drinking it in as attentively as if he had been in church, not daring to cross his legs or to lean his elbows on the desk, and when two o'clock came and the bell rang for dismissal, the master had to call him back to earth and tell him to line up with the rest of us.<br><br>It was our custom, when we came in to class, to throw our caps on the floor, in order to have our hands free. As soon as ever we got inside the door, we 'buzzed' them under the form, against the wall, so as to kick up plenty of dust. That was supposed to be 'the thing.' Whether he failed to notice this manoeuvre or whether he was too shy to join in it, it is impossible to say, but when prayers were over he was still nursing his cap. That cap belonged to the composite order of headgear, and in it the heterogeneous characteristics of the busby, the Polish shapska, the bowler, the otterskin toque and the cotton nightcap were simultaneously represented. It was, in short, one of those pathetic objects whose mute unloveliness conveys the infinitely wistful expression we may sometimes note on the face of an idiot. Ovoid in form and stiffened with whalebone, it began with a sort of triple line of sausage-shaped rolls running all round its circumference; next, separated by a red band, came alternate patches of velvet and rabbit-skin; then a kind of bag or sack which culminated in a stiffened polygon elaborately embroidered, whence, at the end of a long, thin cord, hung a ball made out of gold wire, by way of a tassel. The cap was brand-new, and the peak of it all shiny.<br><br>'Stand up,' said the master.<br><br>He stood up, and down went his cap. The whole class began to laugh.<br><br>He bent down to recover it. One of the boys next to him jogged him with his elbow and knocked it down again. Again he stooped to pick it up.<br><br>'You may discard your helmet,' said the master, who had a pretty wit.<br><br>A shout of laughter from the rest of the class quite put the poor fellow out of countenance, and so flustered was he that he didn't know whether to keep it in his hand, put it on the floor or stick it on his head. He sat down and deposited it on his knees.<br><br>'Stand up,' said the master again, 'and tell me your name.'<br><br>In mumbling tones the new boy stammered out something quite unintelligible.<br><br>'Again!'<br><br>Again came the inarticulate mumble, drowned by the shouts of the class.<br><br>'Louder!' rapped out the master sharply. 'Speak up!'<br><br>Whereupon the boy, in desperation, opened his jaws as wide as they would go and, with the full force of his lungs, as though he were hailing somebody at a distance, fired off the word 'Charbovari.'<br><br>In an instant the class was in an uproar. The din grew louder and louder, a ceaseless crescendo crested with piercing yells--they shrieked, they howled, they stamped their feet, bellowing at the top of their voices: 'Charbovari! Charbovari!' Then, after a while, the storm began to subside. There would be sporadic outbreaks from time to time, smothered by a terrific effort, or perhaps a titter would fizz along a whole row, or a stifled explosion sputter out here and there, like a half-extinguished fuse.<br><br>However, beneath a hail of 'impositions,' order was gradually restored. The master--who had had it dictated, spelled out and read over to him--had at length succeeded in getting hold of the name of Charles Bovary, and forthwith he ordered the hapless wretch to go and sit on the dunce's stool, immediately below the seat of authority. He started to obey, stopped short and stood hesitating.<br><br>'What are you looking for?' said the master.<br><br>'My ca--' began the new boy timidly, casting an anxious glance around him.<br><br>An angry shout of 'Five hundred lines for the whole class' checked, like the <i>Quos ego,</i> a fresh outburst. 'Stop your noise, then, will you?' continued the master indignantly, mopping his brow with a handkerchief which he had produced from the interior of his cap.<br><br>&nbsp;</p><h2>The Future of the Body: Explorations Into the Further Evolution Of Human Nature</h2><p>In the oral and written histories of every culture, there are countless records of men and women who have displayed extraordinary physical, mental, and spiritual capacities. In modern times, those records have been supplemented by scientific studies of exceptional functioning.<br><br> Are the limits of human growth fixed?<br><br> Are extraordinary abilities latent within everyone?<br><br> Is there evidence that humanity has unrealized capacities for self-transcendence?<br><br> Are there specific practices through which ordinary people can develop these abilities?<b><br><br></b>Michael Murphy has studied these questions for over thirty years. <br><br>In <i>The Future of the Body, </i>he presents evidence for metanormal perception, cognition, movement, vitality, and spiritual development from more than 3,000 sources. Surveying ancient and modern records in medical science, sports, anthropology, the arts, psychical research, comparative religious studies, and dozens of other disciplines, Murphy has created an encyclopedia of exceptional functioning of body, mind, and spirit. He paints a broad and convincing picture of the possibilities of further evolutionary development of human attributes.<br><br>By studying metanormal abilities under a wide range of conditions, Murphy suggests that we can identify those activities that typically evoke these capacities and assemble them into a coherent program of transformative practice.<br><br>A few of Murphy's central observations and proposal include:<br><br><li>The observation that cultural conditioning powerfully shapes (or extinguishes) metanormal capacities.</li><br><br><li>The proposition that we cannot comprehend our potentials for extraordinary life without an empirical approach that involves many fields of inquiry and different kinds of knowing.</li><br><br><li>The notion that a widespread realization of extraordinary capacities would constitute an evolutionary transcendence analogous to the rise of humankind from its primal ancestry.</li><br><br><li>The proposal that all or most instances of significant human development are produced by a limited number of identifiable activities such as disciplined self-observation, visualization of desired capacities, and caring for others.</li><br><br><li>The idea that a balanced development of our various capacities is possible through integrated practices.</li><li><b><br><br></b>In <b>The Future Of The Body</b>, Murphy states that such practices can carry forward Earth's evolutionary adventure and lead humanity to the next step in its development.</li></p><p>In 1961&nbsp;<b>Michael Murphy</b>&nbsp;cofounded, with Richard Price, the Esalen Institute, a learning center in California that fosters change in individuals and society, and has hosted thousands of human potential workshops and conferences led by such notables as Joseph Campbell, Aldous Huxley, Joan Borysenko, Allen Ginsberg, and Linus Pauling, to name a few. In 1980, he helped create the Esalen Institute&#x2019;s Soviet American Exchange program, which, among other things, initiated the first live television space bridges and hosted president of the Russian Federation Boris Yeltsin during his first visit to the United States. Murphy is the author of&nbsp;<i>The Future of the Body</i>,&nbsp;<i>Golf in the Kingdom</i>, and&nbsp;<i>An End to Ordinary History</i>, and the coauthor of&nbsp;<i>The Psychic Side of Sports</i>. He lives in San Rafael, California.An impressively researched, authoritative, and absolutely mind-boggling survey of ``the transformative capacities of human nature.'' As to be expected from a co-founder of California's Esalen Institute, the emphasis here is very much on mind-body phenomena, with the focus on individuals who apparently have extended the usual reach of human possibility--saints, mystics, psychics, artists, geniuses, etc. Drawing on an astonishing array of eyewitness accounts, scientific studies, biographies, letters, monographs, etc., Murphy rigorously organizes his vast material into three categories: ``Possibilities for Extraordinary Life''; ``Transformative Practices''; and ``Evidence for Human Transformative Capacity.'' In the last category, for example, he discusses and documents placebo effects, spiritual healing, hypnosis, ``somatic'' disciplines such as the Alexander Technique and the Feldenkrais Method, yogic powers, the charismas of saints, etc. All this fascinating if sometimes sensational information does serve a purpose, of course--to illuminate the author's ``central observations and proposals,'' e.g., that ``the evidence for extraordinary human attributes strongly supports some sort of penentheism....the doctrine that Divinity is both immanent and transcendent to the universe.'' Whatever one thinks of Murphy's conclusions, even a casual dipping into his text, which will no doubt become a primary source for future mind-body investigation, will reveal a world of inspiring wonders. -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Reprint.</p><p>Fans won't find this surprising in the least, but Miles Vorkosigan--the plucky, short-statured hero of Lois McMaster Bujold's beloved series--is uniquely incapable of having an uneventful honeymoon. Between a racially fueled diplomatic dispute, the appearance of a hermaphroditic old flame, and a bizarre Cetagandan genetic conspiracy, Miles just can't seem to get a minute of peace with his new wife, the lovely and resourceful Ekaterin (whom Miles courted in <i>A Civil Campaign</i>). <p> Miles had hoped to give "hands-on op games" a rest once and for all, but when the Emperor urgently calls on him to resolve a "legal entanglement" in Quaddiespace, diplomacy alone might prove inadequate. (Quaddies, you'll remember, are the no-legged, four-armed free-fallers introduced in <i>Falling Free</i>.) Our newly minted Imperial Auditor almost immediately forgets all about "Baby's First Cell Division" (after the assignment comes in, Ekaterin quickly observes "You know, you keep claiming your job is boring, Miles, but your eyes have gone all bright"), but even Miles feels the heat after his diplomatic attempts devolve into a series of flattering assassination attempts. </p><p> Vorkosigan (and family now!) is as winning as ever, with Bujold offering up her usual fun mix of space-opera action and droll social commentary in a character-centered plot. And here's a bonus for Milesophiles and Vorkosiga novices alike: a book-by-book timeline detailing what trouble Miles got into and when. <i>--Paul Hughes</i></p><i>Author's Note</i>:<br>&nbsp;<br><b>A Bujold Reading-Order Guide</b><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><b>The Fantasy Novels</b><br>&nbsp;<br>My fantasy novels are not hard to order. Easiest of all is <i>The Spirit Ring</i>, which is a stand-alone, or aquel, as some wag once dubbed books thatfor some obscure reason failed to spawn a subsequent series. Nexteasiest are the four volumes of <i>The Sharing Knife--</i>in order, <i>Beguilement</i>, <i>Legacy</i>, <i>Passage</i>, and <i>Horizon--</i>which I broke down and actually numbered, as this is one continuous tale.<br>&nbsp;<br>What were called the Chalion books after the setting of its first twovolumes, but which now that the geographic scope has widened I'm dubbing the World of the Five Gods, were written to be stand-alones as part of a larger whole.&nbsp; However, the second volume certainly contains spoilersfor the first, so <i>Curse-Paladin</i> is the recommended readingorder.&nbsp; The third is in effect an independent prequel, not sharingcharacters or setting with the other two, so readers of the priorvolumes need to adjust their expectations going in. In any case, thepublication order is:<br>&nbsp;<br><i>The Curse of Chalion</i><br><i>Paladin of Souls</i><br><i>The Hallowed Hunt</i><br>In terms of internal world chronology, <i>The Hallowed Hunt</i> would fall first, the Penric novellas perhaps a hundred and fifty years later, and <i>The Curse of Chalion</i> and <i>Paladin of Souls</i> would follow a century or so after that.<br><br>Current internal chronology of the Penric &amp; Desdemona tales is:<br><br>"Penric's Demon"<br>"Penric and the Shaman"<br>"Penric's Fox"<br>"Penric's Mission"<br>"Mira's Last Dance"<br><b>Other Original E-books</b><br><b>&nbsp;</b><br>The short story collection <i>ProtoZoa</i> contains five very early tales--three (1980s) contemporary fantasy, two science fiction--all previously published but not in this handy format. The novelette "Dreamweaver's Dilemma" may be of interest to Vorkosigancompletists, as it is the first story in which that proto-universebegan, mentioning Beta Colony but before Barrayar was even thought of.<br>&nbsp;<br><i>Sidelines:Talks and Essays</i> is just what it says on the tin--a collection of three decades of mynonfiction writings, including convention speeches, essays, travelogues, introductions, and some less formal pieces. I hope it will prove aninteresting companion piece to my fiction.<br><b>&nbsp;</b><br>&nbsp;<br><b>The Vorkosigan Stories</b><br>&nbsp;<br>Many pixels have been expended debating the 'best' order in which to readwhat have come to be known as the Vorkosigan Books (or Saga), theVorkosiverse, the Miles books, and other names. The debate mainlyrevolves around publication order versus internal-chronological order. I favor internal chronological, with a few adjustments.<br>&nbsp;<br><i>Shards of Honor</i> and <i>Barrayar.</i> The first two books in the series proper, they detail the adventures of Cordelia Naismith of Beta Colony and Aral Vorkosigan of Barrayar. <i>Shards</i> was my very first novel ever; <i>Barrayar</i> was actually my eighth, but continues the tale the next day after the end of <i>Shards</i>. For readers who want to be sure of beginning at the beginning, or who are very spoiler-sensitive, start with these two.<br>&nbsp;<br><i>The Warrior's Apprentice</i> and <i>The Vor Game</i> (with, perhaps, the novella "The Mountains of Mourning" tucked in between.) <i>The Warrior's Apprentice</i> introduces the character who became the series' linchpin, MilesVorkosigan; the first book tells how he created a space mercenary fleetby accident; the second how he fixed his mistakes from the first round.Space opera and military-esque adventure (and a number of other thingsone can best discover for oneself), <i>The Warrior's Apprentice</i> makes another good place to jump into the series for readers who prefer a young male protagonist.<br>&nbsp;<br>After that: <i>Brothers in Arms</i> should be read before <i>Mirror Dance</i>, and both, ideally, before <i>Memory.</i><br>&nbsp;<br><i>Komarr</i> makes another alternate entry point for the series, picking up Miles's second career at its start. It should be read before <i>A Civil Campaign</i>.<br>&nbsp;<br><i>Borders of Infinity</i>, a collection of three of the five currently extant novellas, makes agood Miles Vorkosigan early-adventure sampler platter, I always thought, for readers who don't want to commit themselves to length. (But it maymake more sense if read after <i>The Warrior's Apprentice</i>.) Take care not to confuse the collection-as-a-whole with its title story, "The Borders of Infinity".<br>&nbsp;<br><i>Falling Free</i> takes place 200 years earlier in the timeline and does not sharesettings or characters with the main body of the series. Most readersrecommend picking up this story later. It should likely be read before <i>Diplomatic Immunity</i>, however,which revisits the "quaddies", a bioengineered race of free-fall dwellers, in Miles's time.<br>&nbsp;<br>The novels in the internal-chronological list below appear in italics; thenovellas (officially defined as a story between 17,500 word sand 40,000words) in quote marks.<br>&nbsp;<br><i>Falling Free</i><br><i>Shards of Honor</i><br><i>Barrayar</i><br><i>The Warrior's Apprentice</i><br>"The Mountains of Mourning"<br>"Weatherman"<br><i>The Vor Game</i><br><i>Cetaganda</i><br><i>Ethan of Athos</i><br><i>Borders of Infinity</i><br>"Labyrinth"<br>"The Borders of Infinity" <br><i>Brothers in Arms</i><br><i>Mirror Dance</i><br><i>Memory</i><br><i>Komarr</i><br><i>A Civil Campaign</i><br>"Winterfair Gifts"<br><i>Diplomatic Immunity</i><br><i>Captain Vorpatril's Alliance</i><br><i>CryoBurn</i><br><i>Gentleman Jole and the Red Queen</i><br>&nbsp;<br>Caveats:<br>&nbsp;<br>The novella "Weatherman" is an out-take from the beginning of the novel <i>The Vor Game</i>.

Turning in many cases from the mean streets of the hardboiled school to explore the anxieties and terrors lurking in everyday life, these groundbreaking novelists found the roots of fear and violence in a quiet suburban neighborhood, on a college campus, or in a comfortable midtown hotel. Their work, influential in its day and still vibrant and extraordinarily riveting today, is long overdue for rediscovery. This volume, the second of a two-volume collector&#x2019;s set, gathers four classic works that together reveal the vital and unacknowledged lineage to today&#x2019;s leading crime writers. From the 1950s here are Charlotte Armstrong&#x2019;s <i>Mischief</i>, the nightmarish drama of a child entrusted to a psychotic babysitter, Patricia Highsmith&#x2019;s <i>The Blunderer</i>, brilliantly tracking the perverse parallel lives of two men driven toward murder, Margaret Millar&#x2019;s <i>Beast in View</i>, a relentless study in madness, and Dolores Hitchens&#x2019;s <i>Fools' Gold</i>, a hard-edged tale of robbery and redemption.<p><b>LIBRARY OF AMERICA</b>&nbsp;is an independent nonprofit cultural organization founded in 1979 to preserve our nation&#x2019;s literary heritage by publishing, and keeping permanently in print, America&#x2019;s best and most significant writing.

The author presents complex and sophisticated teachings and practices in nontechnical language, using engaging stories and personal anecdotes to illustrate his points. <i>Indestructible Truth </i> presents Tibetan Buddhism in its traditional form but also shows how the Tibetan traditions are applicable to the problems and challenges of modern life in the West. <br><br> In <i>Indestructible Truth, </i> Tibetan Buddhism is introduced not as an exotic religion, but rather as an expression of human spirituality that is having a profound impact on the modern world. In addition, it presents the point of view of meditation and the practice of the spiritual life, paying special attention to contemplative practice and meditation as taught in the Kagyu and Nyingma schools.</p><p>Studying Tibetan Buddhism can be like entering a maelstrom of deities, rituals, and scriptures. In a new introduction to the history, the religion, and the philosophy of Tibetan Buddhism, Reginald Ray calms the storm and provides a compass for exploration. A professor and seasoned practitioner, Ray walks the line between objective historian and caring adviser. With spare precision and rich detail, he tells the story of Buddhism in Tibet, from its great progenitors in India to the larger than life transmitters to the series of schools that developed over the centuries. Ray makes no pretense at secularizing Tibetan Buddhism or diminishing its magical elements. He begins with the multifarious Tibetan cosmos but also covers the major tenets of Buddhism, emphasizing the living practices and their results. Capping the book, Ray devotes a section to the development of Buddhist philosophy, again displaying a knack for putting complex issues debated over centuries into just a few easy-to-understand paragraphs. It would be no exaggeration to say that indestructible truth is the best all-around introduction to Tibetan Buddhism you're likely to find. <i>--Brian Bruya</i>Reginald A.

He&#x2019;d recently survived time travel, a war zone, betrayal, deception, mutiny, and the near destruction of time itself. So surely he was brave enough to call up a list of names on a computer.<br> <br>Wasn&#x2019;t he?<br> <br>He kept his finger poised over the computer mouse.<br> <br>I&#x2019;ll be brave enough in a minute, he told himself. Or&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. two.<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong?&#x201d; his sister, Katherine, said from behind him. &#x201c;Did Google lock up or something? Hit that link again.&#x201d;<br> <br>Patience wasn&#x2019;t one of her virtues. Before Jonah had a chance to reply, she shoved her hand over his, pressing his finger down on the mouse.<br> <br>&#x201c;There,&#x201d; Katherine said. &#x201c;Just what we need. Famous missing children in history. Let&#x2019;s see&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;<br> <br>There was a good chance that Jonah&#x2019;s name might be on the list coming up on the computer screen before them. Not his real name&#x2014;not Jonah Skidmore. But his original name. The name he&#x2019;d been born with.<br> <br>To keep from actually looking at the screen now, Jonah whirled in his seat to glare at Katherine.<br> <br>&#x201c;Keep your voice down!&#x201d; he commanded. &#x201c;Do you want Mom or Dad to hear?&#x201d;<br> <br>Unfortunately for Jonah, his parents were the kind who believed all those warnings about monitoring kids&#x2019; computer use. So the Skidmore family computer was right smack in the middle of the kitchen. And Mom and Dad were just around the corner and down the hall, where they were hanging Jonah&#x2019;s and Katherine&#x2019;s newest school pictures along the staircase.<br> <br>Mom and Dad had no clue that Jonah and Katherine had traveled through time again and again and again, their lives in danger in one century after another.<br> <br>But even without the complications of time travel and historical danger and intrigue, Jonah wouldn&#x2019;t have wanted his parents to know how desperate he was to find out his preadoption identity.<br> <br>Not that I exactly want to know it, he told himself. I just&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. need to.<br> <br>&#x201c;Mom and Dad wouldn&#x2019;t mind us talking about history,&#x201d; Katherine said, barely bothering to lower her voice. Then she leaned in closer and dropped her voice to a total whisper: &#x201c;Do you think you might be the Russian kid?&#x201d;<br> <br>She pointed to a name on the screen.<br> <br>Jonah grimaced so fiercely he could barely see.<br> <br>What if I&#x2019;m wrong about everything? he wondered. What if there&#x2019;s some chance my other identity will never actually matter? Can&#x2019;t I go on ignoring it and pretending it doesn&#x2019;t exist?<br> <br>He knew the answer to that question: No. He couldn&#x2019;t. He was only thirteen&#x2014;and Katherine was not quite twelve&#x2014;but in the last few months they&#x2019;d learned that the past had a way of coming back and grabbing you.<br> <br>Sometimes literally.<br> <br>That is not the right way to think about time travel, Jonah told himself. Remember, you have a new attitude now.<br> <br>He forced himself to open his eyes wide enough to read the words on the screen before him&#x2014;and then wider still, in indignation.<br> <br>&#x201c;Alexis Romanov?&#x201d; he protested. &#x201c;No way&#x2014;that&#x2019;s a girl&#x2019;s name!&#x201d;<br> <br>Katherine reached over Jonah&#x2019;s shoulder and clicked on a link for the name.<br> <br>&#x201c;No, it&#x2019;s a guy,&#x201d; she corrected. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s Russian, remember? Sometimes he&#x2019;s listed as Alexis, sometimes Alexei. Same kid, just different translations. Definitely a boy. See?&#x201d;<br> <br>Phrases jumped out at Jonah from the screenful of information she&#x2019;d called up: heir to the throne of the Russian empire&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. World War I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Russian Revolution&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Alexis was imprisoned with the rest of his family&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. then in 1918 the Bolsheviks decided&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br> <br>Jonah didn&#x2019;t know much about Russian history&#x2014;or anything about it, actually&#x2014;but he was pretty sure that things hadn&#x2019;t gone well for this Alexis or Alexei Romanov back in 1918.<br> <br>Well, duh, Jonah told himself. Kids don&#x2019;t vanish from history because everything&#x2019;s going great. All of us were in some kind of danger.<br> <br>For most of his life, Jonah had believed what his parents believed: that he was a perfectly ordinary kid in a perfectly ordinary family, growing up in a perfectly ordinary Ohio suburb. He was adopted and his sister wasn&#x2019;t&#x2014;that was the only detail about him that had ever seemed the least bit unusual. And Jonah&#x2019;s attitude toward that little fact had always been, Well, so what? Who cares?<br> <br>Then the mysterious letters had begun arriving, and Jonah had found out that he wasn&#x2019;t an ordinary adoptee.<br> <br>Not at all.<br> <br>Instead, he and thirty-five other kids were, depending on how you looked at it, either refugees from history or children audaciously stolen from the past. Or both at once. The only reason he and the other kids were growing up now, at the start of the twenty-first century, was because their kidnappers had crash-landed in this time period with a planeload of stolen babies. Fearing the wrath of time agents determined to keep history on its original track, the kidnappers had abandoned the babies and run away, vowing to come back for them as soon as they could.<br> <br>At least we got thirteen years of happy ignorance before everyone started fighting over us again, Jonah thought.<br> <br>And that wasn&#x2019;t the right way to think either. Ignorance wasn&#x2019;t a good thing. Jonah and Katherine had traveled back and forth through history multiple times in the past few months, repairing time and rescuing other kids endangered by their own time periods. How many times on those trips had ignorance almost gotten someone killed?<br> <br>Let&#x2019;s see&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. in 1483&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. 1485&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. 1600&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. 1605&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. 1611&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. 1903&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br> <br>Jonah had returned from his last trip through time vowing to face up to even the facts he desperately didn&#x2019;t want to know.<br> <br>Facts like what his original identity in history actually was.<br> <br>Just yesterday he&#x2019;d asked JB, the time agent he knew best, to finally reveal it.<br> <br>This may have been a little unfair. After their last trip through time, JB was going through an identity crisis of his own. It probably wasn&#x2019;t surprising that JB had refused to tell.<br> <br>So Jonah had decided to take matters into his own hands.<br> <br>Because you never know, Jonah told himself. You never know when I might be zapped back in time, when I might have to deal with whatever historical mess this Alexis or Alexei Romanov&#x2014;or whoever I really am&#x2014;had to deal with. I refuse to take another time-travel trip blind!<br> <br>He made himself focus on the words on the screen and read them in order, not skipping around:<br> <br>Alexis Romanov, the last tsarevitch of Russia, was born in 1904. He had four older sisters&#x2014;Olga, Tatiana, Maria, and Anastasia&#x2014;but as the first and only male child of Tsar Nicholas II, he was the designated heir, intended from birth to inherit the throne. At that time, the Russian empire covered a sixth of the globe&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br> <br>Jonah stopped reading.<br> <br>&#x201c;If I really was, like, the future leader of Russia, don&#x2019;t you think I&#x2019;d&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; He let his voice trail off, because there was no way he could say what he was thinking. If I really am this kid, shouldn&#x2019;t I feel more special? Shouldn&#x2019;t I be smarter, more talented&#x2014;more obviously someone capable of ruling a sixth of the planet?<br> <br>&#x201c;What? Do you think you should look more like a prince&#x2014;or a &#x2018;tsarevitch&#x2019; or whatever the Russians called it?&#x201d; Katherine teased. &#x201c;Do you think you shouldn&#x2019;t look like such a goofball?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;How I should look&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;,&#x201d; Jonah muttered. &#x201c;Duh, Katherine, we&#x2019;re idiots. In 1918 they had cameras. They&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>He stopped explaining and started typing instead. He clicked back over to Google and started an image search for Alexis or Alexei Romanov.<br> <br>Within seconds he&#x2019;d called up a picture of a boy in a sailor suit. The kid was maybe nine or ten, and staring unsmilingly toward the camera. It was a black-and-white image, so it was impossible to tell if the boy&#x2019;s hair was brown or just dark blond. It was impossible to tell eye color. It was impossible to tell why the boy looked so serious. But Jonah could tell one thing for sure:<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not me,&#x201d; he said, relief swimming over him.<br> <br>Katherine squinted at the picture.<br> <br>&#x201c;Maybe you just think that because it&#x2019;s such an old picture, and you&#x2019;re used to seeing yourself in this century,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Or&#x2014;you know how sometimes people don&#x2019;t look like themselves in one particular shot?&#x201d;<br> <br>Jonah clicked the back arrow, returning to the lineup of dozens of images of Alexis/Alexei Romanov. He reached to the top of the computer desk, where Mom had stashed the packets of the other copies of his and Katherine&#x2019;s school pictures, ready to be handed out to various relatives at Thanksgiving. He shook out a five-by-seven of himself and held it up beside the computer screen.<br> <br>&#x201c;See?&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;No way that&#x2019;s me.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; Katherine said softly.<br> <br>She was looking too closely at the picture of Jonah. Jonah couldn&#x2019;t help staring at it too.<br> <br>Did anybody like his or her seventh-grade school picture? Jonah&#x2019;s hair stuck up in a weird way, and his grin was both crooked and too wide. But there was something else about the picture that bothered Jonah.<br> <br>It was taken back in September, before I got the first letter. Before I went back in time for that first trip. It might as well have been a million years ago.<br> <br>The Jonah in the picture looked too baby-faced, too unformed, too innocent.<br> <br>Too ignorant.<br> <br>It hurt, just looking at this picture of the kid Jonah had once been.<br> <br>No wonder Katherine was doubtful about Jonah and Alexei/Alexis&#x2019;s appearance. Even Jonah didn&#x2019;t look like himself anymore.<br> <br>He turned the picture facedown and slipped it back into the packet at the top of the computer desk. He caught only a glimpse of the packet of Katherine&#x2019;s school pictures, the multiple images of her blond hair, her blue eyes, and her confident gaze, which seemed to say, You think there are going to be a lot of mean girls in sixth grade? So what? I&#x2019;m not worried!<br> <br>As if that was all Katherine was ever going to have to worry about.<br> <br>Katherine looked like a total little kid in her school pictures from a few months ago too.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, hey,&#x201d; he said loudly, trying to distract himself and Katherine. He pointed back toward the computer screen. &#x201c;Why are all these pictures of girls mixed in with the images of the boy Alexis? Maybe you&#x2019;re wrong after all.&#x201d;<br> <br>Katherine took control of the mouse and the keyboard again.<br> <br>&#x201c;No, those are his sisters,&#x201d; she said, clicking through images until she came to a large one of four girls in lacy white dresses and Alexis/Alexei&#x2014;looking much younger&#x2014;in yet another sailor suit. &#x201c;Do you remember, back in the time cave, back in the beginning of all this, when we saw all the names of the missing kids from history on that plane? Two Romanovs were on that list, weren&#x2019;t they? Alexis and Anastasia?&#x201d; She zoomed in until only the two youngest children showed on the screen. &#x201c;Do these kids look familiar?&#x201d;<br> <br>Jonah frowned. He had met almost all of the other kids stolen from history in the time cave, the day the original kidnappers had come back hoping to retrieve each one of them. But Jonah didn&#x2019;t have quite enough imagination to mentally replace the old-fashioned lace dress and sailor suit in the picture of the Romanovs with the modern jeans and T-shirts and sweatshirts the other kids had been wearing in the time cave.<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; Jonah said irritably.<br> <br>Anastasia and Alexis Romanov seemed to stare back at him from the computer screen, their expressions plaintive and pleading. Jonah wished he&#x2019;d never thought to look for pictures. Now that he knew he himself wasn&#x2019;t a Romanov, he didn&#x2019;t want to learn anything else about these kids. It was too much of a burden. He already had to worry about his friends Chip and Alex, trying to recover from the trauma of the 1400s, and his friend Andrea, who&#x2019;d wanted to stay in 1600 even though it was a complete mess, and Emily, who&#x2014;<br> <br>Katherine gasped beside him. Jonah turned and saw that she&#x2019;d gone totally pale.<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong with you?&#x201d; he muttered.<br> <br>&#x201c;Everyone&#x2019;s just supposed to be missing, right?&#x201d; Katherine asked, her voice shaking. &#x201c;You and the other kids&#x2014;you just vanished from history and nobody was ever supposed to know what happened to you. Isn&#x2019;t that how it was always supposed to be? For all thirty-six of you?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Uh, sure,&#x201d; Jonah said uneasily. &#x201c;Why?&#x201d;<br> <br>Katherine raised a trembling hand and pointed to a sentence Jonah hadn&#x2019;t noticed before, directly below the picture on the screen.<br> <br>&#x201c;Because,&#x201d; Katherine said. &#x201c;Because this says Anastasia and Alexis Romanov are dead.&#x201d;</p><h2>Married &#39;til Monday (A Chapel Springs Romance)</h2><p><p><strong>With a big anniversary party in the works for his ex-wife&#x2019;s parents, Ryan has just one weekend to play Abby&#x2019;s husband&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and win back the woman of his dreams.</strong></p><p>Ryan McKinley has tried to move on from his ex-wife, Abby.

From these dire opening lines, a delightful story of adventure begins. One family will emerge alive from this terrible storm: the Robinson's -- a Swiss pastor, his wife, and four sons, plus two dogs and a shipload of livestock, hens, pigeons and geese! Inspired by Daniel Defoe's "Robinson Cruesoe," this heartwarming tale portrays a family's struggle to create a new life for themselves on a strange and fantastic tropical island. There each boy must learn to control his own nature -- such as Ernest's bookishness and Fritz's hot temper -- as their adventures lead to amazing discoveries, danger, and tantalizing surprises, including a puzzling message tied to an albatross's leg. But it is the authenticity of the boys' behavior, the ingenuity of the family, and the natural wonders of this exotic land that have made <i>The Swiss Family Robinson</i>, first published in 1812-1813, one of the world's best-loved and most enduring stories of shipwreck and survival.<b>Johann David Wyss (1743-1818)</b> was, like the narrator of his famous story of survival on an uninhabited island, a Swiss pastor who had four sons. It was to entertain and instruct these children that he devised the idea of the island and its plethora of natural resources, but the writing of <b>Der schweizerische Robinson</b> is said to have been the responsibility of one of the sons, Johann Rudolf (1782-1830). First published in 1812, it was first translated into English two years later. Since then its translators have been many and they have freely adapted and expanded the original German text, making it one of the most popular novels of all time. <b>Louis John Rhead (1857-1926)</b>, an American artist, was born in England.

If her name is not well known, her work certainly is. Colter was an employee of the Harvey Company from 1910 to 1948, and her main task was the design and decoration of Harvey hotels and restaurants along the Santa Fe Railway. A versatile designer who integrated authentic regional elements into strong themes, Colter was responsible for famous hotels such as El Navajo in Gallup, NM; La Posada in Winslow, AZ; and Painted Desert Inn in Painted Desert, AZ. Her rustic-styled buildings at the Grand Canyon, including the Hopi House, Bright Angel Lodge, and others, influenced National Park Service development, and the style became known as National Park Service Rustic. This sympathetic and well-documented book by Berke, an editor at Preservation magazine who also writes on historic architecture, includes new photographs. The final chapter describes the fates of many Colter buildings, including the restoration of some survivors. Recommended for regional public and academic libraries. David R.

To describe and clarify these processes, he ranges widely in history and geography: from ancient society through the medieval period to modern revolutions, and over India, Africa, Europe, China, and Meso-America.</p><p>Two chapters, which illustrate religious paradigms and political action, explore in detail the confrontation between Henry II and Thomas Becket and between Hidalgo, the Mexican liberator, and his former friends. Other essays deal with long-term religious processes, such as the Christian pilgrimage in Europe and the emergence of anti-caste movements in India. Finally, he directs his attention to other social phenomena such as transitional and marginal groups, hippies, and dissident religious sects, showing that in the very process of dying they give rise to new forms of social structure or revitalized versions of the old order.</p></p><p><p>Victor Turner (1920&#x2013;1983) was professor of religion and anthropology at the University of Chicago.

Professionals will love working with this book in their practices, and clients will love working through their perfectionism with such a useful guide.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;<b>Mercedes Samudio, LCSW</b>, parent coach, and best-selling author of <i>Shame-Proof Parenting</i> -- Mercedes Samudio, LCSW<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m a big fan of workbooks because they allow the reader to become an active participant in their self-help efforts. Sharon Martin&#x2019;s contribution to help people fight perfectionism is a fantastic antidote to getting perfectionism&#x2019;s maladaptive behaviors better under control. Martin offers a direct and no-nonsense look at perfectionism that eschews psychobabble, pulling together techniques in a cohesive and sensible manner. This workbook works well as either an adjunct to psychotherapy, or as a stand-alone guide to those in need of help of silencing the perfectionist in themselves. There&#x2019;s no better book on the market that offers such practical advice and exercises for someone who wants better control over their perfectionism.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;<b>John M. Grohol, PsyD</b>, founder and editor-in-chief of www.psychcentral.com -- John M. Grohol, PsyD<br><br>&#x201c;Many people struggle with perfectionism whether it&#x2019;s in our workplaces, in relationships, or the battle within ourselves. And many books talk about its root causes and how perfectionism affects the human psyche. But rarely do books offer ways to address perfectionism. In <i>The CBT Workbook for Perfectionism</i>, Sharon Martin offers practical, concrete, research-driven ways to let go of struggles like self-criticism, procrastination, people-pleasing, and the need for control. A must-read for anyone whose potential has been hindered by perfectionism.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;<b>Melvin Varghese, PhD</b>, psychologist, and founder of Selling The Couch -- Melvin Varghese, PhD<br><br>&#x201c;Perfectionism can be paralyzing, but Sharon Martin gives you a road map to reclaim your life. Sharon expertly guides you to down a path to self-discovery, and arms you with exercises to find mental and emotional freedom. For lifelong high achievers, <i>The CBT Workbook for Perfectionism </i>is a must-have companion that will help you embrace imperfect action and reach your goals with less stress.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;<b>Melody Wilding, LMSW</b>, peak performance coach, and adjunct professor of human behavior at The City University of New York -- Melody Wilding, LMSW<br><br>&#x201c;Sharon Martin has been a trusted resource for my clinical work for years. She has a way of breaking down complex topics into understandable explanations, which makes them easier to understand and address. This workbook is no exception. She clearly explains what perfectionism is, how it shows up in our lives, where it comes from, and what we can do to change the perfectionistic behavior, which can be so problematic in our lives. This workbook includes so many effective strategies to help those of us who struggle because of perfectionism, and I plan to use it in my individual work with clients as well as with groups. I highly recommend this book to clinicians and the general public alike.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;<b>Laura Reagan, LCSW-C</b>, integrative trauma therapist, and host of the <i>Therapy Chat</i> podcast -- Laura Reagan, LCSW-C</p><h2>Loose Leaf for Focus on Personal Finance</h2><p><p><em>Focus on Personal Finance</em> is a brief, 14-chapter book, covering the critical topics in Personal Finance courses.

Cosmism went the furthest in its visions of transformation, calling for the end of death, the resuscitation of the dead, and free movement in cosmic space. This volume collects crucial texts, many available in English for the first time, by the radical biopolitical utopianists of Russian Cosmism.</p><p>Cosmism was developed by the Russian philosopher Nikolai Fedorov in the late nineteenth century; he believed that humans had an ethical obligation not only to care for the sick but to cure death using science and technology; outer space was the territory of both immortal life and infinite resources. After the revolution, a new generation pursued Fedorov's vision. Cosmist ideas inspired visual artists, poets, filmmakers, theater directors, novelists (Tolstoy and Dostoevsky read Fedorov's writings), architects, and composers, and influenced Soviet politics and technology. In the 1930s, Stalin quashed Cosmism, jailing or executing many members of the movement. Today, when the philosophical imagination has again become entangled with scientific and technological imagination, the works of the Russian Cosmists seem newly relevant.</p><p><b>Contributors<br></b>Alexander Bogdanov, Alexander Chizhevsky, Nikolai Fedorov, Boris Groys, Valerian Muravyev, Alexander Svyatogor, Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, Anton Vidokle, Brian Kuan Wood</p><p>A copublication with e-flux, New York</p></p><p>Boris Groys is Professor of Russian and Slavic Studies at New York University, Senior Research Fellow at the Academy of Design in Karlsruhe, Germany, and Professor at the European Graduate School in Saas Fee, Switzerland.

Today, as Benjamin Ginsberg warns in this eye-opening, controversial book, "deanlets"--administrators and staffers often without serious academic backgrounds or experience--are setting the educational agenda.<br><br><em>The Fall of the Faculty</em> examines the fallout of rampant administrative blight that now plagues the nation's universities. In the past decade, universities have added layers of administrators and staffers to their payrolls every year even while laying off full-time faculty in increasing numbers--ostensibly because of budget cuts. In a further irony, many of the newly minted--and non-academic--administrators are career managers who downplay the importance of teaching and research, as evidenced by their tireless advocacy for a banal "life skills" curriculum. Consequently, students are denied a more enriching educational experience--one defined by intellectual rigor. Ginsberg also reveals how the legitimate grievances of minority groups and liberal activists, which were traditionally championed by faculty members, have, in the hands of administrators, been reduced to chess pieces in a game of power politics. By embracing initiatives such as affirmative action, the administration gained favor with these groups and legitimized a thinly cloaked gambit to bolster their power over the faculty. <br><br>As troubling as this trend has become, there are ways to reverse it. <em>The Fall of the Faculty </em>outlines how we can revamp the system so that real educators can regain their voice in curriculum policy.<br></p><p><br><strong>Benjamin Ginsberg</strong> is the David Bernstein Professor of Political Science, Director of the Center for the Study of American Government, and Chair of the Center for Advanced Governmental Studies at Johns Hopkins University. His previous books include <em>Downsizing Democracy</em>, <em>American Government: Power and</em> <em>Purpose</em>, and <em>We the People: An Introduction to American Politics</em>.<br><br>"This book takes a hard, clear-eyed look, with few holds barred, at the growing number and influence of full-time administrators in colleges and universities. It recognizes the large increase in government and other demands on the bureaucracy. But it dwells on the manifest fact--too often slighted--that administrators have their own fish to fry. Let us hope that his cautionary tale has a wide impact."--Morton Keller, Professor Emeritus of History, Brandeis University<p></p><br>"During my nearly 60 years as a professor, I believe this is the only comprehensive analysis of the academic civil war between the professors and the deans. Ginsberg demonstrates why and how we're losing--or have already lost."--Theodore J. Lowi, Professor of American Institutions, Cornell University<p></p><br>"Ben Ginsberg knows a thing or two about academic bureaucracy. He has had extensive experience with administrative impediments that come between his ideas and their realization. Instead of ranting, he has written <em>The Fall of the Faculty,</em> where he has employed his political insight to examine administrative bloat in higher education and to explain the many ways in which administrative authority has elbowed aside faculty governance in the running of today's colleges and universities. As a recovering deanlet and one-time acting dean, I know whereof he speaks."--Matthew A. Crenson, Professor Emeritus of Political Science, Johns Hopkins University<p></p><br>"In his lacerating "The Fall of the Faculty," Mr. Ginsberg argues that universities have degenerated into poorly managed pseudo-corporations controlled by bureaucrats so far removed from research and teaching that they have barely any idea what these activities involve. He attacks virtually everyone from overpaid presidents and provosts down through development officers, communications specialists and human-resource staffers but he reserves his most bitter scorn for the midlevel "associate deans" and "assistant deans" who often have the most direct control over the faculty. Mr. Ginsberg refers to them as "deanlets," but at my institution they are often called "ass. deans." The Fall of the Faculty" reads like a cross between a grand-jury indictment and a call to arms. Yet as bracing and darkly pleasurable as this call is, it is hard to imagine professors joining the resistance with so few weapons at their disposal."--The Wall Street Journal<p></p><br></p><h2>Everything You Always Wanted to Know about God (But Were Afraid to Ask)</h2><p><b>Who doesn&#x2019;t have questions about God?

Buck, Madeleine L'Engle, Taylor Caldwell, and O.

This task-oriented and reflective approach makes this the first field manual to emphasize the investigative instrument (the ethnographer) as well as the cultural situations, informants, and techniques of analysis.</p></p><p></p><h2>An Egyptian Hieroglyphic Dictionary : With an Index of English Words, King List, and Geographical List with Indexes, List of Hieroglyphic Characters, Coptic and Semitic Alphabets (Vol 1)</h2><p>At last, an English dictionary of Egyptian hieroglyphics. This monumental work&#x2014;long out of print, a very hard and rare book to find&#x2014;was prepared by one of the foremost Egyptologists of the century. It contains nearly 28,000 words or terms that occur in hieroglyphic texts dating from the Third Dynasty through the Roman period, roughly from 3000 B.C. to 600 A.D. It is the only complete English dictionary available anywhere. For students, teachers, collectors, libraries, museums or anyone seriously interested in deciphering ancient Egyptian writings, magical formulas or inscriptions for themselves, this book is a must!<br>Arranged alphabetically, each entry consists of the transliteration of the word, the word in hieroglyphs, the meaning in English, and often, a literary or other textual source where the word can be found. The entries in the 915-page main dictionary include all the gods and goddesses as well as other mythological beings, the principle kings of Egypt, and geographical names. Professor Budge also gives in the beginning a full list of the most frequently used hieroglyphic characters arranged, after the manner of printers' Egyptian-type catalogues, by pictorial similarity (men, women, gods and goddesses, parts of the body, animals, birds, reptiles, fish, insects, plants, sacred vessels, weapons, measures, etc.) with phonetic values and meanings when used as determinatives and ideographs. Reference alphabets or syllabaries for Coptic, Hebrew, Syriac, Arabic, Ethiopic, Amharic and Persian cuneiform are also here.<br>The secondary aids are quite extensive (over 550 pages worth) and most useful. In the second volume, there's an index of English words with 60,000 entries. This forms an extremely handy English-Egyptian glossary. Also included in this volume are hieroglyphic lists of royal and geographical names (with separate indexes to these lists), and indexes of Coptic and non-Egyptian words quoted in the dictionary itself (with a separate section for non-Egyptian geographical names).<br>The long, scholarly and informative introduction outlines the history of the decipherment in Europe of Egyptian hieroglyphs and lexicography (citing such pioneers as Akerblad, Young, Champollion le Jeune, Birch, Lepsius, Brugsch, Chabas, Goodwin E. de Roug�, and others), explains the principles of the present work, and offers a full bibliography. Everything you need to study hieroglyphs is in these two volumes.</p><p>E. A.

Blackstone demonstrated that the English law as a system of justice was comparable to Roman law and the civil law of the Continent. Clearly and elegantly written, the work achieved immediate renown and exerted a powerful influence on legal education in England and in America which was to last into the late nineteenth century. The book is regarded not only as a legal classic but as a literary masterpiece. <br><br>Previously available only in an expensive hardcover set, <i>Commentaries on the Laws of England</i> is published here in four separate volumes, each one affordably priced in a paperback edition. These works are facsimiles of the eighteenth-century first edition and are undistorted by later interpolations. Each volume deals with a particular field of law and carries with it an introduction by a leading contemporary scholar. <br><br>In his introduction to this first volume, <i>Of the Rights of Persons</i>, Stanley N. Katz presents a brief history of Blackstone's academic and legal career and his purposes in writing the <i>Commentaries</i>. Katz discusses Blackstone's treatment of the structure of the English legal system, his attempts to justify it as the best form of government, and some of the problems he encountered in doing so. <br></p><p>It was the dominant lawbook in England and America in the century after its publication and played a unique role in the development of the fledgling American legal system.<b>Stanley N. Katz </b>is professor of legal history at Princeton University.

They infiltrated the highest ranks of society and posed a major threat not only to the Catholic Church but also to secular authorities as well. The movement was finally smashed by the crusade and the inquisitional proceedings that followed. This new study is the first comprehensive history of the Cathars. It addresses major topics in medieval history including heresy, orthodoxy and the Crusades as well as providing a history of the social and political history of Languedoc and the rise of the Capetian dynasty. A fascinating study of the development of radical religious belief and its violent suppression.</p><p><p>The Cathars were dualist heretics who, in the twelfth and early thirteenth centuries, presented more coherent doctrinal opposition to the Catholic church than any contemporary movement. They were present in most areas of Latin Christendom, but they were particularly strong in southern France and northern Italy, where they drew adherents from all social classes. <br> <br>This new book traces the origins and spread of dualist ideas, assesses their attraction for contemporaries, and describes the reaction of the ecclesiastical and lay authorities in the form of preaching campaigns, intellectual refutation, crusade, and inquisitorial investigations.

When Isabel Archer, a beautiful, spirited American, is brought to Europe by her wealthy aunt Touchett, it is expected that she will soon marry. But Isabel, resolved to enjoy her freedom, does not hesitate to turn down two eligible suitors. Then she finds herself irresistibly drawn to Gilbert Osmond. Charming and cultivated, Osmond sees Isabel as a rich prize waiting to be taken. In this portrait of a &#39;young woman affronting her destiny&#39;, Henry James created one of his most magnificent heroines, and a story of intense poignancy. This edition is based on the earliest published copy of the novel: this is the version that was read first and loved by most readers in James&#39;s lifetime. It also includes an introduction, notes and other editorial materials by leading James scholar Philip Horne. Henry James was born in 1843 in Washington Place, New York, of Scottish and Irish ancestry. In addition to many short stories, plays, books of criticism, autobiography and travel, he wrote some twenty novels, the first published being Roderick Hudson (1875). They include The Europeans, Washington Square, The Portrait of a Lady, The Bostonians, The Princess Casamassima, The Tragic Muse, The Spoils of Poynton, The Awkward Age, The Wings of the Dove, The Ambassadors and The Golden Bowl.

He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2012.<b>PREFACE</b><p>Someone asked me the other day: What exactly does a record producer do? My answer was: &#x201c;You just have to have an opinion and the ego to express it more convincingly than anyone else.&#x201d; Every time I start another project I wonder if I am going to get found out.</p><p>So much of what any of us achieve in life has a massive element of good fortune attached. In my case, you can start with being born in 1942, which tipped me out into the workplace just as things were getting interesting in the music business, along with a whole host of artists who were to change the face of popular music. They were to drag me with them on the crest of a wave through an extraordinary period of change, not only in the music they were writing and performing but in the structure of the industry itself. Every now and then, when the opportunity presented itself, I would try to &#x201c;express my opinion more convincingly than anyone else,&#x201d; and there were a few who took notice.</p><p>I started working as a recording engineer in 1959, just before the demise of the 78. It was the beginning of the vinyl age. Mono was the thing and stereo was only for hi-fi freaks.</p><p>Bill Haley and His Comets had started the American rock and roll invasion in Britain in the mid-fifties, and it had been rammed home by Elvis, Fats Domino, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Chuck Berry, to name but a few. They dominated the charts in the UK, along with ballad singers like Doris Day, Tony Bennett, and Perry Como. British artists were just copying whatever was arriving from across the pond, even singing with an American accent. There had not as yet been a homegrown response. Music was still extremely safe and somewhat insipid in comparison to what was to follow.</p><p>The record industry as we know it now was in its infancy. In England they were grappling with the trickle before the floodgate opened to the changes that were about to take place. Those in charge had no concept of what was about to happen and most certainly did not lead the way. As a result, some of them fell by the wayside, others were led by the nose, and some were clever enough to sit back, keep quiet, and allow themselves to be carried through the next few years by the explosion of youth that was to take over.</p><p>The ensuing years were full of excitement, much adrenaline, many dawn choruses, and extremes of every emotion you can imagine. I was blasted through my youth into middle age with an extraordinary combination of creative people, sounds, rhythm, and lyrics in a period of time that I believe is unlikely to ever be repeated. I have been extremely fortunate in witnessing firsthand some wonderful moments with some truly fantastic, innovative artists while making records as an engineer and producer over the last fifty years, and watching the creative process change into something almost unrecognizable from where I started. All this while plowing my way through the minefield of &#x201c;the business&#x201d; and the incredible cast of characters it threw up&#x2014;managers, lawyers, entrepreneurs, promoters, publishers, and so-called executives, large and small.</p><p>AT IBC STUDIOS IN THE SIXTIES.<br><br><b>Early Years</b></p><p>Ihave no idea why my mother took me as an eight-year-old to join the parish church choir. My father was an atheist, and she drifted in and out of Christianity throughout her life, never attending church on anything like a regular basis until my father retired many years later. Perhaps it was because I had shown an interest in it at school, although my only memory of singing in the choir at my primary school was, when I was five, being pulled out of line and slapped on the calf by an extremely rotund Miss Butterworth for talking when I should have been listening. I remember this incident clearly and have often wondered why, as I can recall very little else from those early years. Maybe it was the vicious expression on her fat face. I remember she bit her bottom lip as she applied her hand to my bare leg with as much force as she could muster. I was embarrassed and cried and could not understand the satisfaction she seemed to get from the experience.</p><p>There I was, committed to two choir practices a week, on Tuesdays and Fridays, three services on Sunday, and as many weddings on a Saturday that required the services of the boy sopranos. Weddings were the best because we got paid for them. At first, I got nine pence for each one, which increased to one shilling and sixpence when I eventually became head chorister. So if we did three or four weddings on a Saturday the proceeds would go a long way in Lowman&#x2019;s store, with a lot left over for the odd puncture kit for the bike or a visit to the local indoor swimming pool. Four Old English pennies to get in and three to buy a bag of hot chips from the fish and chip shop on the way home.</p><p>My life very quickly began to revolve around the church and the two-and-a-half-mile walk to and from it. It would take me past Lowman&#x2019;s and on to the churchyard with its narrow, winding asphalt path that threaded its way through tilting ancient gravestones leading straight past the vestry to the west door of the church. The path was faintly lit with sparsely placed lampposts, which on a foggy night in midwinter threw a mysterious damp haze on the gravestones and the gathering of young boys waiting impatiently for the arrival of our great leader, Mr. Felton Rapley, the choirmaster and extremely accomplished organist of St. Martin&#x2019;s Parish Church in Epsom.</p><p>Mr. Rapley was a very large man who always seemed to be in a hurry. He had a serious, all-knowing face like an owl. He had thick horn-rim glasses, thinning gray hair, and a gray walrus mustache. He was intimidating to an eight-year-old. However, he was to become my mentor during the next few years. Perhaps he was my first hero.</p><p>Sometimes I would arrive early for choir practice, and as I approached the church, I could hear him rehearsing his next recital. I would sit outside on the wall by the vestry door in the dark, transfixed by the sheer size of the organ&#x2019;s sound penetrating the dimly lit stained-glass windows. The whole sensation was magnified by the fact that it was taking place in the middle of a graveyard that dated back to the fifteenth century.</p><p>There is nothing quite like the experience of singing with a large group of people, your senses being bombarded by all those harmonics and actually contributing some of your own. Felton Rapley spotted my enthusiasm quite early on and quietly took me under his wing. As I grew older he encouraged me more and more, giving me the odd solo and slowly boosting my confidence until he made me head chorister at the age of eleven.</p><p>He was considered to be one of the finest pipe organists in the country, performing regularly on BBC radio. He would give a recital every fourth Sunday after Evensong, and one such Sunday he asked if I would stay after the service and turn pages for him. I naturally jumped at the chance to see the great man perform. We could never see him when he played during a service. The organ loft was way up above us some thirty or forty feet, surrounded by this massive array of pipes, rather like a giant Gulliver&#x2019;s panpipes. Although this was opposite where I stood in the choir stalls, I could only ever see his balding head and his shoulders swaying, physically accenting what he played. He had a long mirror up above his head so he could keep his eye on the transgressors eating boiled sweets or reading the Beano or Eagle comic during one of those interminably boring sermons.</p><p>Evensong finished and I followed Mr. Rapley as he propelled himself up the steep narrow stone spiral staircase that led from the vestry up to the organ loft. His enormous frame brushing the walls on either side, with his long black gown flowing behind him. He always seemed short of breath on the flat, as a result of him smoking large numbers of Senior Service cigarettes when outside the confines of the church, so by the time he made it to the top he seemed to be completely knackered. He sat down heavily on one end of the organ bench, bent over, and with some difficulty changed his shoes for a pair of patent leather slippers. I remember being terribly impressed, having never seen anything quite so opulent. He swung round, squeezing himself between the bench and the three keyboards that fanned out in front of him, set the music on its stand, and pressed a couple of preset buttons, which caused the two vertical banks of porcelain knobs on either side of the keyboard to jump in and out with great speed and a resounding thump. As he began to play, he was transformed before my very eyes. His energy level seemed to quadruple. The cumbersome movement of his somewhat overweight body disappeared and became fluid, his fingers flying across the keyboard with extraordinary speed and accuracy. His shiny feet dancing over the pedals with the dexterity of a ballet dancer.</p><p>I found this transformation, and the sound that was belting out of the organ pipes, completely enthralling. The sheer energy and emotion of it had a profound impact on me, as I realized that the performance of a piece of music could have such a dramatic effect not only on the listener but also on the performer.</p><p>Most years when we were children, my mother would take my two older sisters, my younger brother, and me to stay with her brother Robert, known as Chum, on his farm in Devon for our summer holidays. It was an idyllic, magical place for me. Beautiful rolling countryside, woodland, and streams to explore. All new experiences to interest and excite the senses of a small child from just outside the suburbs of London.</p><p>My uncle Chum quickly became one of my favorite people. He was an extremely handsome man with a kind, somewhat weathered face and a wonderful twinkle in his eye. He would sit and tell stories of his life before the Second World War. How he would race his Bugatti at Brooklands motor racing track in the thirties. My mother had newspaper clippings of him and his older brother George, who raced for the Bentley team and had won the European Grand Prix in the thirties.</p><p>It was in that farmhouse kitchen that I became totally infatuated by a completely different form of music than that of the church choir. In the evening, after dinner, he would play Django Reinhardt records and then take out this old acoustic guitar and sing these wonderful American folk songs. My uncle was a fine player and had the most encapsulating voice, but more than anything it was his personality and the manner in which he performed the songs that made such an enormous impression on me, as he turned into the character that each song&#x2019;s story required with consummate ease. It was a similar experience to that of watching Felton Rapley play the organ, the performer being transformed into someone else as the music took over.</p><p>When I was twelve or thirteen, the local operatic society performed Handel&#x2019;s Messiah at the church and I was asked to be a soloist. Being the only child, and I am sure for dramatic effect, I sang my solo from the sanctity of the organ loft with the comfort of being close to Mr. Rapley. This was much better, as I was looking down at the scene from on high and felt secure from the massed singers and audience of several hundred people below. Shortly after this, Mr. Rapley suggested that I audition for a weekly religious program on BBC radio that featured a boy soprano. The lad who had the job was getting on in years and his voice was about to break. I passed the audition and excitedly waited for my big opportunity, that is, until my voice broke, and that was the end of that. The first of many disappointments in the music business.</p><p>� � �</p><p>Icalled into Mr. Lowman&#x2019;s store on the way back from church one Sunday and we got chatting. I told him how my next-door neighbor had lent me a four-string tenor guitar and how I was trying to teach myself to play it. He asked me to wait a minute and reappeared with a pristine, lime-green Guild electric guitar. &#x201c;Borrow this,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m looking after it for my brother.&#x201d; I had never seen anything like it. I took it home and just looked at it in the case for several days, petrified that some harm would come to it if I took it out. I eventually plucked up the courage and as I had no idea how to play it, sat around posing with it in my bedroom, periodically checking myself in the mirror. I soon returned it to Mr. Lowman with much gratitude. I was hooked.</p><p>I stayed on at the church as a server and started going to the church youth club on Wednesday nights. Among other delights, we would have discussion nights and play table tennis and were taught ballroom dancing, which didn&#x2019;t appeal to me at all, but at least you got to put your arm around a girl legitimately. One evening we had a talent night. I remember a boy in his early teens no one had seen before, who sat with his legs swinging over the front edge of the stage and played an acoustic guitar. He was pretty good, he may have even won, but I don&#x2019;t think anyone in the hall that night had any idea that he was to become such an innovative force in modern music. This was to be my first meeting with Jimmy Page.</p><p>� � �</p><p>By the time I was fifteen, in 1957, my head was being turned by traditional jazz. There was a band that had been formed by some of the seniors at school, but when I showed interest, I was rejected on sight, with a cuff round the ear for impertinence, as I was considered to be nothing but a &#x201c;snotty&#x201d; youngster from the middle school. The clarinet player in the band was Dick Morrissey, who went on to become one of the all-time great English modern jazz saxophonists. Many years later, I booked him as a soloist on a couple of sessions at Olympic Studios. When I reminded him of the incident at school, he was kind enough to say he remembered it but I&#x2019;m pretty sure he didn&#x2019;t.</p><p>So, not to be put off, I made myself a tea chest bass and started playing with the Terry Emptage Band at my older sister Sue&#x2019;s college&#x2019;s student union Thursday-night do. I was several years younger than the rest of the band so there was not a great deal of communication between us but I didn&#x2019;t care. I was playing and having a ball.</p><p>It is the simplest of instruments to make and to play. Having acquired from the local grocer a large square plywood crate, originally used for shipping loose tea, you turn it upside down (as the top has been removed to get at the tea), and nail a long pole to the middle of one side. Then attach one end of a piece of picture-hanging cord to the top of the pole and the other through a hole in the middle of the top of the chest. To play it, you just put one foot on the box and vigorously attack the cord with your right hand in some sort of rhythm while altering the pitch by pulling back and releasing the pole with your left.</p><p>My biggest problem was getting around. I managed to devise a way of carrying the bass on my bicycle. I would put it over my shoulder and stuff the pole under the handlebars and pedal for miles in a most precarious manner. Everything would be fine if it was not a windy evening. It&#x2019;s a wonder I ever made it anywhere unscathed, or unarrested for that matter, for being a danger to others on the road.</p><p>Soon there were more gigs around the area. I couldn&#x2019;t travel much more than ten miles if I was to be fit enough to play on arrival.

Author Bio</p> <p>II. Author Letter</p> <p> <b>&nbsp;</b> </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p> <b>I. Author Bio</b> </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Robert Paul Wolff was born in 1933 in New York City. He was educated at Harvard University, receiving his doctorate in philosophy in 1957. Following a brief period of service in the military, he taught at Harvard, The University of Chicago, Columbia University, and the University of Massachusetts, from which he retired in 2008 after a career spanning half a century. Wolff is the author or editor of twenty-three books, which have been translated into sixteen languages. He is best known around the world for a short book titled <i>In Defense of Anarchism</i>, which has most recently appeared in Croatian, Malaysian, and Korean. For a somewhat more extended biography, you may consult the article on him on Wikipedia.com. Those who want to know every last detail of his life may read his eight hundred page, three volume, autobiography, which is posted on box.net and is accessible from his blog: www.robertpaulwolff.blogspot.com . Wolff is married to his childhood sweetheart, Susan, and lives in Chapel Hill, NC. He has two sons: Patrick Gideon Wolff, a famous International Chess Grandmaster who now is the Managing Director of a hedge fund, Grandmaster Capital, and Tobias Barrington Wolff, a leading Gay Rights legal activist and Professor of Law at the University of Pennsylvania. Wolff has one cat, named Christmas Eve.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In 1990, after several years of activity in the movement to end apartheid in South Africa and liberate the South African people, Wolff founded University Scholarships for South African Students, which has in the past two decades helped more than one thousand five hundred young Black men and women in South Africa get a higher education. In March, 2011, Wolff was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of the Western Cape in South Africa in recognition of his work for South African higher education.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <b> <p>II. Author Letter</p> </b> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Dear Colleagues, </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>With this eleventh edition, <i>About Philosophy</i> approaches the completion of its fourth decade. Now, we philosophers are trained to view questions under the aspect of eternity, <i>sub specie aeternitatis</i>, so forty years is as nothing to us. But though we live with the eternal, our students very definitely do not! Despite our best efforts to remain <i>au courant</i>, we cannot keep up with the ever-changing world in which they live. Just this past semester, I mentioned Gilbert and Sullivan&#x2019;s light operas to a class of bright graduate students, and they looked at me blankly. As Heraclitus reminded us a mere two and a half millennia ago, "you can never step into the same river twice, for other waters are ever flowing onto you."</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In a continuing effort to accommodate <i>About Philosophy</i> to the mercurial frame of reference of our students, I have regularly replaced old "Contemporary Applications" with new ones. Almost that entire portion of the text has been completely redone for this edition. My favorite is the Contemporary Application for the chapter on the Philosophy of Art, which features a painting done by a dog. I have looked at that painting right side up, upside down, and sideways, and I have to confess that I cannot see how it differs from the abstract expressionist paintings now commanding six and seven figure prices at art auctions.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Anyone my age grew up in a linear world of books, but my grandchildren inhabit a multi-dimensional world of hypertexts. They move easily from text to text, site to site, linking ideas and texts in ways I never would have thought to do. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>I am confident that we have struck the right balance between the eternal and the fleeting. The basic philosophical ideas and arguments are still here &#x2014; they do not change. But this material will now be available to our students in ways that they are comfortable with. I look forward to hearing from you abut how it all works together.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Thank you once again for your loyalty to this text, and for the invaluable suggestions you have made over the years for its improvement.

This book challenges that consensus and argues instead that only four parables&#x2014;those of the Mustard Seed, the Evil Tenants, the Talents, and the Great Supper&#x2014;can be attributed to the historical Jesus with fair certitude. In this eagerly anticipated fifth volume of <i>A Marginal Jew,</i> John Meier approaches this controversial subject with the same rigor and insight that garnered his earlier volumes praise from such publications as the <i>New York Times</i> and <i>Christianity Today.</i> This seminal volume pushes forward his masterful body of work in his ongoing quest for the historical Jesus.</p><p><b>John P.

At various times he has been the editor or associate editor of&nbsp;The Catholic Biblical Quarterly, New Testament Studies,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Dead Sea Discoveries.&#x201c;<i>The Marginal Jew</i> . . . is a splendid achievement that advances discussion of the historical Jesus, and of the scholarly approaches by which this discussion can take place.&#x201d;&#x2014;Amy-Jill Levine, <i>Interpretation</i><br>&#x201c;Meier&#x2019;s endeavor is clearly the biggest scholarly undertaking in the quest of the historical Jesus by any single individual since its inception in the late eighteenth century.&#x201d;&#x2014;Craig L. Blomberg,<i>&nbsp;Journal of Evangelical Theological Society</i><br>"John Meier's refusal to belong to a particular 'school' of Gospels research is clearly evident in this latest volume in the<i>&nbsp;Marginal&nbsp;Jew</i> series. His remarkable erudition both in the primary sources and in the extensive secondary literature is palpable throughout. He is the very model of a sober and learned contrarian!"&#x2014;Simon Gathercole, University of Cambridge<br>"The subject of the parables is one of the more daunting areas of historical Jesus research. Yet, with his characteristic wisdom and wit, John Meier guides us through the many parables that are attached to Jesus' name. Freely conceding that in many cases utter certainty will escape us, Meier shows us which parables are most likely from the lips of Jesus and why."&#x2014;Gary A. Anderson, University of Notre Dame<br>"This book is a breath of fresh air&#x2014;refreshingly forthright about what can and cannot be said about the parables attributed to Jesus. Meier shows that the parables can no longer be seen as the bedrock for reconstructing the historical Jesus. Yet four parables have a demonstrable origin in his teaching."&#x2014;Adela Yarbro Collins, Yale University<br>"Seldom in the history of scholarship has one scholar so attractively combined both scientific and theological sophistication as does John Meier, one of our leading experts on the Historical Jesus. In this fifth volume of his definitive <i>Marginal Jew</i> series, Meier explores the authenticity of Jesus&#x2019; parables."&#x2014;James H.

Claims that climate change isn't settled science, that evolution is &#x201c;only a theory,&#x201d; and that scientists are conspiring to keep the truth about vaccines from the public are staples of some politicians' rhetorical repertoire. Defenders of science often point to its discoveries (penicillin! relativity!) without explaining exactly why scientific claims are superior. In this book, Lee McIntyre argues that what distinguishes science from its rivals is what he calls &#x201c;the scientific attitude&#x201d;&#x2015;caring about evidence and being willing to change theories on the basis of new evidence. The history of science is littered with theories that were scientific but turned out to be wrong; the scientific attitude reveals why even a failed theory can help us to understand what is special about science.&nbsp;</p><p>McIntyre offers examples that illustrate both scientific success (a reduction in childbed fever in the nineteenth century) and failure (the flawed &#x201c;discovery&#x201d; of cold fusion in the twentieth century). He describes the transformation of medicine from a practice based largely on hunches into a science based on evidence; considers scientific fraud; examines the positions of ideology-driven denialists, pseudoscientists, and &#x201c;skeptics&#x201d; who reject scientific findings; and argues that social science, no less than natural science, should embrace the scientific attitude. McIntyre argues that the scientific attitude&#x2015;the grounding of science in evidence&#x2015;offers a uniquely powerful tool in the defense of science.</p></p><p>Lee McIntyre is a Research Fellow at the Center for Philosophy and History of Science at Boston University. He is the author of <i>Dark Ages: The Case for a Science of Human Behavior</i> and <i>Post-Truth</i>, both published by the MIT Press.<p>&#x201c;After a three-decade career devoted to studying (and often debunking) pseudoscience and science denial, I am emboldened by Lee McIntyre's deeply insightful examination and clarification of what, exactly, science is and how it differs from pseudoscience. In this age of fake news and alternative facts, when creationists, climate deniers, and anti-vaxxers are taken seriously by media and voters, this important book could not come at a more crucial time. Now, more than ever, evidence matters, and the evaluation of evidence is what science does best."</p>&#x2015;<b>Michael Shermer</b>, publisher of <i>Skeptic Magazine</i> and columnist for <i>Scientific American</i>; Presidential Fellow at Chapman University; author of <i>Why People Believe Weird Things</i>, <i>The Believing Brain</i>, <i>The Moral Arc</i>, and <i>Heavens on Earth</i><br><br><p>&#x201c;The philosophy of science owes something to science, something it has never yet provided, not for want of trying: an explanation of its standing as objective knowledge. We've long needed a reliable way to mark the difference between reliable science and seductive pseudoscience. Now we need one to defend the achievements of science against those who deny them by misrepresenting its persistent demands for more and better evidence as weakness instead of strength. Creation science is pseudoscience and climate science isn't. But we still haven't had a principled explanation of why. It's Lee McIntyre's achievement to have finally given us one.&#x201d;</p>&#x2015;<b>Alex Rosenberg</b>, R. Taylor Cole Professor of Philosophy, Duke University; author of How History Gets Things Wrong and The Atheist's Guide to Reality<br><br><p>&#x201c;What makes science special? According to McIntyre's deeply original yet highly accessible new book, it is not any special principle or method. It's the attitude of those who engage in it. To engage in science is to care about empirical evidence and be willing to change your mind when it doesn't go your way. This is an important book for our post-truth culture.&#x201d;</p>&#x2015;<b>Michael Patrick Lynch</b>, Humanities Institute, University of Connecticut; author of The Internet of Us and Know-It-All Society<br><br><p>&#x201c;This remarkably original book presents not so much a defense of uncertainty and doubt in science as a call to celebrate it&#x2015;and a method for doing so. Steeped in solid philosophy, McIntyre presents not a simple work-around, but a full-on case for what he refreshingly identifies as the 'scientific attitude'. Forget about the scientific method and all the endless arguments about fallibility and proof&#x2015;it's the attitude that makes a scientist and that builds a scientific community. What precisely that 'attitude' is, and why it's important, awaits you in the pages of this book.&#x201d;</p>&#x2015;<b>Stuart Firestein</b>, Professor and Chair, Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University; author of Ignorance: How It Drives Science and Failure: Why Science Is So Successful</p><h2>The Philosophy of Symbolic Forms: Vol. 3: The Phenomenology of Knowledge</h2><p>The <i>Symbolic Forms</i> has long been considered the greatest of Cassirer&#x2019;s works.&nbsp; Into it he poured all the resources of his vast learning about language and myth, religion, art, and science&#x2015;the various creative symbolizing activities and constructions through which man has expressed himself and given intelligible objective form to this experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;These three volumes alone (apart from Cassirer&#x2019;s other papers and books) make an outstanding contribution to epistemology and to the human power of abstraction.&nbsp; It is rather as if &#x2018;The Golden Bough&#x2019; had been written in philosophical rather than in historical terms.&#x201d;&#x2015;F.I.G.

Erwin Panofsky&nbsp;posits that there were "reanscences" prior to the widely known Renaissance that began in Italy in the 14th century. Whereas earlier renascences can be classified as revivals, the Renaissance was a&nbsp;unique instance that led to a&nbsp;wider cultural&nbsp;transformation.</p><p>Panofsky&#39;s study brings welcome light into the darkness. His subject is the character of Renaissance art--in the strictest sense of the word-and its uniqueness in comparison with art produced during earlier revivals of the classical heritage.Erwin Panofsky</p><h2>Facing the Lion: Growing Up Maasai on the African Savanna</h2><p>Joseph Lemasolai Lekuton gives American kids a firsthand look at growing up in Kenya as a member of a tribe of nomads whose livelihood centers on the raising and grazing of cattle. Readers share Lekuton&#39;s first encounter with a lion, the epitome of bravery in the warrior tradition. They follow his mischievous antics as a young Maasai cattle herder, coming-of-age initiation, boarding school escapades, soccer success, and journey to America for college. Lekuton&#39;s riveting text combines exotic details of nomadic life with the universal experience and emotions of a growing boy.</p><p>Joseph Lemasolai Lekuton is a Maasai tribesman who grew up on the savanna of northern Kenya. He teaches eighth grade social studies in Langley, Virginia and holds a master&#39;s degree in International Education Policy from Harvard University. Each summer he brings a group of students and parents to Kenya to work on development projects that help his people.Gr. 5-12. This simple memoir is the extraordinary story of a poor nomadic boy in Kenya who literally travels across the world but never abandons home. Lekuton grew up in Kenya's poorest tribe, herding cows and playing in trees and hyena holes before he entered a missionary boarding school and went to college in the U.S. Now he teaches in Virginia, but he has never lost his Maasai roots, and he returns home to help his people several months a year. Looking back without romanticism or self-pity, he remembers how it was: the joy and excitement, the constant hunger and moving, and the traditions, including the circumcision ceremony that made him a man. The Cinderella theme begins in Kenya where he's the shabby kid accepted at a fancy Nairobi high school. Later he travels to his college interview in a cattle truck with the cows. What gives this short, readable book its power is Lekuton's authoritative, intimate view of now and then. <i>Hazel Rochman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

The award-winning author team of Jeanne H. Ballantine, Keith A. Roberts, and Kathleen Odell Korgen organizes the text around the "Social World Model," a conceptual framework that demonstrates the relationships among individuals (the micro level); organizations, institutions, and subcultures (the meso level); and societies and global structures (the macro level).

Although only twenty-four when he signed his first publishing contract for the book, Joyce already knew its worth: to alter it in any way would "retard the course of civilization in Ireland." Joyce's aim was to tell the truth-- to create a work of art that would reflect life in Ireland at the turn of the last century and by rejecting euphemism, to reveal to the Irish their unromantic reality, which would lead to the spiritual liberation of the country. Each of the fifteen stories offers glimpses into the lives of ordinary Dubliners-- a death, an encounter, an opportunity not taken, a memory rekindled - and collectively they paint a portrait of a nation.<br>This edition is introduced and annotated by Jeri Johnson, who gives a witty and informative insight into the context, meanings, and reception of Joyce's work.<br><br><strong>About the Series:</strong> For over 100 years <strong>Oxford World's Classics</strong> has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe.

The Latin Kings, one of the largest and most notorious street gangs in America, became his refuge and his world, but its violence cost him friends, freedom, self-respect, and nearly his life. This is a raw and powerful odyssey through the ranks of the new mafia, where the only people more dangerous than rival gangs are members of your own gang, who in one breath will say they&#x2019;ll die for you and in the next will order your assassination.<br></p><p>In <i>My Bloody Life</i>, Reymundo Sanchez tells a chillingly sad tale, from his birth in the back of a pickup truck in Puerto Rico to the day he quit the Latin Kings gang, 21 years later. From the first page, his narrative is unpretentious, disarmingly honest, and horrifyingly riveting. His early years were so full of pain and abuse that by the time he opts, at age 11, to hang out with the local gang, the Latin Kings, it seems a perfectly logical choice. In his shoes, any one of us--smacked nightly by a mother and beaten ragged whenever the stepfather got the chance--would likely have chosen the same path. The gang was the family that accepted him as well as the peer group that offered girls who didn't say "no." Any violence that went with the territory couldn't match the atmosphere of brutality that permeated his own home.<p> Sanchez was a Latin King for six years and participated in innumerable bloody gang battles--years rife with sex, drugs, booze, and acts of gang revenge. He finally got up his pluck to leave (and the only way was to be "violated" out through a gang beating), but admits in his conclusion that life since then has, in some ways, been even harder. He's had to quit drugs, lose the only community he's known, support himself, and deal with the nightmares of all the horrors he's seen and done. Though Sanchez still hasn't accomplished his dream of completing college, he has managed to leave the Kings, leave Chicago, leave behind his mother's legacy of violence, and write an impressive first book. <i>--Stephanie Gold</i></p>CA</p><h2>The Gates of Europe: A History of Ukraine</h2><p>Ukraine is currently embroiled in a tense fight with Russia to preserve its territorial integrity and political independence. But today's conflict is only the latest in a long history of battles over Ukraine's territory and its existence as a sovereign nation. As the award-winning historian Serhii Plokhy argues in <i>The Gates of Europe</i>, we must examine Ukraine's past in order to understand its present and future.<br><br>Situated between Central Europe, Russia, and the Middle East, Ukraine was shaped by the empires that used it as a strategic gateway between East and West&#x2014;from the Roman and Ottoman empires to the Third Reich and the Soviet Union. For centuries, Ukraine has been a meeting place of various cultures. The mixing of sedentary and nomadic peoples and Christianity and Islam on the steppe borderland produced the class of ferocious warriors known as the Cossacks, for example, while the encounter between the Catholic and Orthodox churches created a religious tradition that bridges Western and Eastern Christianity. Ukraine has also been a home to millions of Jews, serving as the birthplace of Hassidism&#x2014;and as one of the killing fields of the Holocaust.<br><br>Plokhy examines the history of Ukraine's search for its identity through the lives of the major figures in Ukrainian history: Prince Yaroslav the Wise of Kyiv, whose daughter Anna became queen of France; the Cossack ruler Ivan Mazepa, who was immortalized in the poems of Byron and Pushkin; Nikita Khrushchev and his prot�g�-turned-nemesis Leonid Brezhnev, who called Ukraine their home; and the heroes of the Maidan protests of 2013 and 2014, who embody the current struggle over Ukraine's future.<br><br>As Plokhy explains, today's crisis is a tragic case of history repeating itself, as Ukraine once again finds itself in the center of the battle of global proportions. An authoritative history of this vital country, <i>The Gates of Europe</i> provides a unique insight into the origins of the most dangerous international crisis since the end of the Cold War. <br><br></p><p><b>Serhii Plokhy</b> is the Mykhailo Hrushevsky professor of Ukrainian history at Harvard and the director of the university's Ukrainian Research Institute.

I was interested in journalism, advertising, or some other line of business, but the economy was bad, and good jobs were hard to come by. I ended up processing claims for an insurance company in Los Angeles. In principle, it was a job I was lucky to have. It offered the possibility of a future. The problem was, the work seemed dull and repetitive to me. Even as I kept showing up and collecting decent paychecks, I knew I wanted to do something that I found more interesting with my life.<br> <br>One day, I skipped work and drove across town to the University of Southern California to inquire about graduate school. I wasn't sure it was what I wanted to do, assuming I could even get in, but a few months later, I was a student again, attending a university rightfully known (in no particular order) for its excellent academics, athletics, beautiful campus, famous library, and attractive women. The classes were interesting. I read great books, listened to eloquent lectures, took copious notes, and now and then, made nervous contributions to the class discussions. There was nothing not to like until a few weeks into the semester, when I had to complete my first writing assignment.<br> <br>I started four or five days before the deadline, which was smart, but even so, after several hours at my desk, I managed to produce only a few lame sentences. I gave up and tried again the next day, with similar results. Writing "papers" had never been a problem for me as an undergraduate. I wrote them, and usually earned good grades, but unfortunately, I had no awareness of how I did it. By the end of the second day, my frustration turned into panic. I had produced a half page of jumbled ideas. What had I gotten myself into? I didn't know how to write. I decided to take the next day off. I still had a few days left until the deadline. Desperation might inspire me. If not, maybe the insurance company would have me back.<br> <br>I believe in the adage that we make our own luck, but now and then we are beneficiaries of sheer luck, too. On my self-appointed day off, I received a letter from my best friend, a writer and teacher from Albuquerque, who was then living abroad in Paris. His letters came about once a month, never less than four or five pages long, typed, single-spaced, and double-sided to save on postage, and they were like movies arriving in the mail (before anyone had heard of Netflix), full of humorous incidents, odd characters, rants, and vivid images of life in one of the world's great cities. I read his letter that day, savoring every word and marveling, as I always did, at how his words came alive on the page. When I finished reading, I wrote him back--no doubt, an anemic letter compared to his, but still, two or three pages, in his postage-saving format, about life in Los Angeles, a city that has its own share of quirks, charms, and odd characters to write about. As I was folding the letter into an envelope, I thought, "I can write this letter, but I can't write that paper. What's the difference?"<br> <br>The next day I went to work on the paper again, writing it the only way I apparently knew how, the way I had written the letter, focusing on what interested me, why I was interested, and why I thought someone else might be, or should be, and saying all of that as clearly and directly as I could, not worrying about how it sounded or might be judged. The writing went much better. I submitted the paper on time, and the professor's judgment wasn't terrible--a "B," with a comment along the lines of, "Interesting but doesn't add up to much." Well, at least, I had proven I wasn't completely out of my depth.<br> <br>As the semester progressed, my papers improved and were a little easier to write. By the end of the term, I had done well enough in my coursework to earn a fellowship to teach first-year composition. I was given a crash training course while I was already teaching my first class. What I mainly learned from the training course, as well as from teaching the class, was that I didn't know much. I was teaching a skill I was still learning myself, not a skill I had figured out or mastered. Yet I did know something: how difficult, humbling, and even scary writing could be, how easy it was to get stuck and fail. Fortunately for my students, I also had a few unfledged but viable ideas about how to address these problems, how to help students move past them, write with more confidence, and see better results.<br> <br>Today, those formative experiences as a graduate student and student teacher are "long ago and far away." I have taught college writing for more than twenty-five years, and I know much more now than I did then, but not so much that I have forgotten what still matters and applies most: what it is like to be a student, how difficult writing can be, and above all, what writers can do to make writing easier, more effective, and enjoyable. Those basic goals, and my belief in the value that writing has for students and the value of what students have to say, remain the foundation of my teaching and go to the heart of why I have written this book.<br><br>Robert Saba<br>Robert Saba is the associate director of undergraduate writing programs at Florida International University in Miami. He has taught college writing for more than twenty-five years, specializing in first-year composition, advanced research, approaches to literature, courses about the history of the essay, and personal narratives.

An appendix looks at a wide range of disorders including allergies, asthma, and hyperactivity, and how to teach a child who is reluctant to eat. The author also discusses the benefits and drawbacks of giving young children vitamins.</p><p>Confused about feeding your baby or toddler? <i>Child of Mine</i>, by noted nutritionist Ellyn Satter, is an essential guide for every new parent concerned with nutrition and appetite. Satter's advice is thorough and straightforward: "You can't control or dictate the quantity of food your child eats, and you shouldn't try. You also can't control or dictate the kind of body your child develops, and you shouldn't try. What you can do, and it is a great deal, is set things up for your child so she, herself, can regulate her food intake as well as possible, and so she can develop a healthy body that is constitutionally right for her." <p> <i>Child of Mine</i> provides information on all aspects of feeding, from pregnancy through the toddler years. Satter begins with historical and social perspectives on infant feeding, describing how formula was developed and discussing the social movement that lead to accepting a child's input into his or her own development. Nutrition during pregnancy, infant feeding, introducing solid foods, building positive eating relationships, and avoiding eating disorders are all discussed. The sections on breastfeeding vs. bottle feeding, and on the regulation of food intake (particularly the relationship between parental attitudes and children's eating habits) are especially recommended. </p><p> Satter provides specific nutritional information (including charts, diagrams, and nutritional breakdowns) interspersed with a no-nonsense, experienced perspective that will help you establish good eating habits that your children will benefit from long after they're out of diapers. <i>--Ericka Lutz</i></p><b>Ellyn Satter, MS, RD, CICSW, BCD</b>, is an internationally recognized authority on eating and feeding.

His no-nonsense approach to listing machining rules-of-thumb is an unprecedented, effective way to share this valuable knowledge.As machinists, how often are we asked to produce hardware that was needed "yesterday?" The fact is, quite often as shop personnel try to keep "squeaky wheels" greased. Squeaky wheels come at us from all sides. Production people count on machinists to keep lines going, research and development people count on machinists to keep new product programs on track, maintenance people count on machinists for repair parts and so on. <p>The bottom line is when people want parts; they want parts. They don&#x2019;t want excuses or anything else. That's one of the beauties of being a machinist. Your responsibilities are clear and simple. If you can get people their blessed parts, they'll go away. </p><p>Most people, including myself, don&#x2019;t want to work any harder or faster than we have to. At times though, when the crisis monkey is on us, we have to get the lead out and get going.

Do you break out in a sweat when you see more than a few numbers hanging out together? Then <i>I'm Trying to Love Math</i> is for you! In her signature hilarious style, Bethany Barton introduces readers to the things (and people) that use math in amazing ways -- like music, and spacecraft, and even baking cookies! This isn't a how-to math book, it's a way to think differently about math as a necessary and cool part of our lives!</p><p><b>Bethany Barton</b>&nbsp;is an author and illustrator who celebrates life with painting, laughter, and as much time on her snowboard as possible. She lives and works (making art and painting sets) in Los Angeles.K-Gr 2&#x2014;As an invisible narrator begins to express a distaste for math, a three-eyed purple alien arrives in a flying saucer to make a case for why math is important and helpful. Unconvinced, the narrator makes several attempts to love math but these efforts seem to prove that math is boring. All of these arguments are rebuffed by the alien, who shows that math is a crucial part of cooking, music, nature, and navigation. By the end of the book, both the narrator and the reader come to the realization that math is connected to many things that they enjoy, so maybe they already love it. This engaging volume is filled with colorful, splashy illustrations; two unique lettering styles are used to differentiate between the narrator's words and those spoken by the alien. Although it is not as much of a smash as Barton's I'm Trying to Love Spiders, this book offers ample opportunity for readers to interact with the text and have conversations with and about the narrator and the friendly, pro-math alien.

Based on interviews with high level defectors from Cuba&#39;s powerful intelligence and security services, long-buried secrets of Fidel&#39;s nearly 50-year reign are exposed for the first time. They include numerous assassinations and attempted ones carried out on Castro&#39;s orders, some against foreign leaders. More than a dozen ranking Cuban secret agents embraced by the CIA and FBI speak in these pages; some have never told their stories on the record before. Latell also probes dispassionately into the CIA&#39;s most deplorable plots against Cuba - including previously obscure schemes to assassinate Castro - and presents shocking new conclusions about what Fidel actually knew of Lee Harvey Oswald prior to the assassination of John F. Kennedy.</p><p><p><b>BRIAN LATELL</b> began tracking Cuba for the CIA in the early 1960s.

Is this the fate of all revolutionary movements? It does seem to be the case: Russia, China, Cuba. The United States completed its exclusive 1776 revolution and faced Shays&#x2019; Rebellion only through civil war and battles over civil rights.</p><p>The Mexican Revolution (1910-20 in its armed phase) began as a united movement against the three decades of authoritarian rule of General Porfirio D�az. Its democratic leader, Francisco Madero, came to power in 1911 and was overthrown and murdered in 1913 by the ruthless general Victoriano Huerta, who promptly restored the dictatorship and was opposed by the united forces of Venustiano Carranza, �lvaro Obreg�n, and Francisco &#x201c;Pancho&#x201d; Villa in the north and those of the agrarian leader Emiliano Zapata in the south. But when Huerta, defeated, fled in 1915, the revolution broke up into rival factions. Zapata and Villa came to represent popular forces, agrarian and small town, while Carranza and Obreg�n were seen as leaders of the rising middle class that D�az had suffocated under the patrimonialist regime of huge haciendas using low-paid peon labor.</p><p>Mariano Azuela (1873-1952) was a country doctor who joined first Carranza, then Villa. In 1915, right in the middle of the war, he sat down and wrote a disenchanted tale of revolution sprung from one man&#x2019;s experience. A chronicle, a novel, a testimony,<i> The Underdogs</i> is all of this, but above all it is a degraded epic, a barefoot<i> Iliad</i> sung by men and women rising from under the weight of history, like insects from beneath a heavy stone. Moving in circles, blinded by the sun, without a moral or political compass, they come out of darkness, abandoning their homes, migrating from hearth to revolution.</p><p>The people of Mexico are &#x201c;the armies of the night&#x201d; in Azuela&#x2019;s book. They give the reader the impression of a violent, spontaneous eruption. But be warned. The immediacy that Azuela brings to the people is a result of the long mediacy of oppression: half a millennium of authoritarian rule by Aztec, colonial, and republican powers. If this weight of the past at least partly explains the brutality of the present, it applies not only to the mass of the people but also to the protagonists, the leaders, the individuals that Azuela thrusts forward: the revolutionary general Demetrio Mac�as and the revolutionary intellectual &#x201c;Curro&#x201d; Cervantes, accompanied by a host of supporting players. Like the people, Mac�as and Cervantes are heirs to a history of authoritarian power and submission. But if the rebellious mass is moving, however blindly,<i> against</i> the past, Mac�as and Cervantes are<i> repeating</i> the past. They are rehearsing the role of the Indian, Spanish, and republican oppressor, Mac�as on the active front and Cervantes on the intellectual side. They both see Mexico as their personal patrimony. They want to be fathers, judges, teachers, protectors, jailers, and, if need be, executioners of the people, but always in the name of the people.</p><p><i>The Underdogs</i> thus presents us with a wide view of the social, political, and historical traits of Mexico and, by extension, of Latin America: it is a degraded epic but also a chronicle of political failure and of aspiring nationhood. There are no Latin American novels prior to independence in the 1820s. I might say that it is the nation that demands its narration, but also that narration needs a nation to narrate. This, indeed, links the origins of both the North American and Latin American novel. Whatever they actually are, they first appeared along with &#x201c;the birth of the nation.&#x201d;</p><p>The novel is a critical event. Religion demands faith, logic demands reason, politics demands ideology. The novel demands criticism: critique of the world, along with a critique of itself. While literature and the imagination are deemed superfluous (especially) in satisfied societies, the first thing a dictatorship does is to censor writing, burn books, and exile, imprison, or murder writers.</p><p>Do we need authoritarian repression to demonstrate the importance of literature, the critical freedom of words and the imagination? I cannot separate Azuela&#x2019;s moral and literary significance from the fact that he drew a critical portrait of the Mexican revolutionary movement as it was happening, setting a standard of critical freedom that has prevailed in my country in spite of seven decades of authoritarian rule by a single party. There has been repression in Mexico&#x2014;of political parties, individuals, unions, agrarian movements, journalists&#x2014;but writers have maintained a high degree of critical independence. This is thanks to a very early exercise of this independence by Mariano Azuela and<i> The Underdogs,</i> followed by the critical chronicles of Mart�n Luis Guzm�n, Jos� Vasconcelos, and Rafael Mu�oz.</p><p>This critical tradition against all odds should be compared with the silence imposed on Soviet writers by Stalinism, the exile of German writers from Nazi Germany, or the persecution of North American authors during the McCarthy era. The margin of critical and creative freedom, menaced by the political powers&#x2014;always, everywhere&#x2014;was maintained in Mexico thanks, in great measure, to the stakes planted by Mariano Azuela.</p><p>Azuela began his writing career with a Zolaesque naturalist novel,<i> Mar�a Luisa</i> (1907), and went on to register the foibles of politics (<i>Andr�s P�rez, maderista,</i> 1911), political bosses (<i>Los caciques,</i> 1917), the middle classes (<i>Tribulaciones de una familia decente,</i> 1918) and the labor movement (<i>El camarada Pantoja,</i> 1937).<i> The Underdogs (Los de abajo),</i> nevertheless, remains his signature book, and its universal import is well taken as he describes human conduct that has the troubling quality of repeating itself everywhere and in all historical periods. The forces of social ascent and corruption: &#x201c;Now we are the swells,&#x201d; the grotesque camp follower<i> La Pintada</i> [War Paint] says as she assumes the heritage of the former proprietors.</p><p>Corruption unites the best and the worst. In one of the greatest scenes of the novel, several characters, pretending to sleep, see the others in the act of stealing. A common language of dishonesty, cover-up, and government by kleptocracy is born. It is a thieves&#x2019; pact of worldwide resonance. This is, indeed, a disenchanted epic, in which fatality engenders bitterness and bitterness enhances fatality, both illustrated by the scene where General Mac�as rolls a stone down a hill, murmuring: &#x201c;Look at this stone, how it cannot stop.&#x201d;</p><p>And yet, perhaps this epic of failures (or failed epic) is a great novel because, for all its realism, even in spite of its cynicism, it is<i> astonished</i> by a world it no longer understands. And it is this wonderful sense of surprise that gives <i>Los de abajo</i> its lasting wonder.</p><p>&#x2014;CARLOS FUENTES</p><p>Introduction</p><p><i>The Underdogs</i> is the most important novel of the Mexican Revolution. In its pages, we follow the actions of a band of revolutionaries&#x2014;led by the protagonist, Demetrio Mac�as&#x2014; at the height of the revolution&#x2019;s armed phase, from 1913 to 1915. The novel works mainly with realism to portray many of the harsh details and effects of the revolution, indirectly drawing our attention to the possible motivations that drive Demetrio Mac�as and his men to fight. The novel is written in fragmentary prose, and although it is interspersed with moments of beautiful description, it is driven primarily by the dialogue of the protagonists and the surrounding characters themselves. This, combined with frequent, jarring narrative changes&#x2014;such as alterations in verb tense; choppy, staccato exchanges in the dialogue; and temporal and spatial jumps&#x2014;serves to reflect the jarring experiences that the characters encounter.</p></p><h2>An Introduction to Poetry</h2><p>Written with the student in mind, this text includes an impressive collection of both traditional and contemporary poems representing a cultural diversity of authors and a richness in the range of style.

Kennedy, </b>after graduation from Seton Hall and Columbia, became a journalist second class in the Navy ("Actually, I was pretty eighth class"). His poems, some published in the New Yorker, were first collected in <i>Nude Descending a Staircase</i> (1961). Since then he has written five more collections, several widely adopted literature and writing textbooks, and seventeen books for children, including two novels. He has taught at Michigan, North Carolina (Greensboro), California (Irvine), Wellesley, Tufts, and Leeds. Cited in <i>Bartlett's Familiar Quotations</i> and reprinted in some 200 anthologies, his verse has brought him a Guggenheim fellowship, a Lamont Award, a Los Angeles Times Book Prize, an award from the American Academy for Poetry for Children from the National Council of Teachers of English. He now lives in Lexington, Massachusetts, where he and his wife Dorothy have collaborated on four books and five children. </p><p> <b>Dana Gioia</b> is a poet, critic, and teacher. Born in Los Angeles, he attended Stanford and Harvard before taking a detour into business. ("Not many poets have a Stanford M.B.A., thank goodness!") After years of writing and reading late in the evenings after work, he quit a vice presidency to write and teach. He has published three collections of poetry: <i>Daily Horoscope</i> (1986); <i>The Gods of Winter</i> (1991); <i>Interrogations at Noon</i> (2001), winner of the 2001 American Book Award; an opera libretto, <i>Nosferatu</i> (2002); several anthologies; and an influential study of poetry's place in contemporary America, <i>Can Poetry Matter?</i> (1992). Gioia has taught at Johns Hopkins, Sarah Lawrence, Wesleyan (Connecticut), Mercer, and Colorado College.

Eric Drexler is the founding father of nanotechnology&#x2014;the science of engineering on a molecular level. In <i>Radical Abundance</i>, he shows how rapid scientific progress is about to change our world. Thanks to atomically precise manufacturing, we will soon have the power to produce radically more of what people want, and at a lower cost. The result will shake the very foundations of our economy and environment.<br><br>Already, scientists have constructed prototypes for circuit boards built of millions of precisely arranged atoms. The advent of this kind of atomic precision promises to change the way we make things&#x2014;cleanly, inexpensively, and on a global scale. It allows us to imagine a world where solar arrays cost no more than cardboard and aluminum foil, and laptops cost about the same.<br><br>A provocative tour of cutting edge science and its implications by the field's founder and master, Radical Abundance offers a mind-expanding vision of a world hurtling toward an unexpected future.<br></p><p><b>K. Eric Drexler</b> developed, named, and popularized the concept of nanotechnology. Currently at the Programme on the Impacts of Future Technology at Oxford University, Drexler is a frequent public speaker on scientific issues, addressing audiences of politicians, business leaders, scientists, and engineers in the Americas, Europe, and Asia.<br><b><i>Kirkus</i></b>&#x201c;A stimulating tour through current thinking about and future possibilities for nanotechnology, from one of its creators... A crackerjack piece of science and technology writing.&#x201d;<br><br><b><i>Albany Times Union</i></b>&#x201c;K. Eric Drexler writes in his accessible new book "Radical Abundance" that the digital revolution is about to give way to a form of production that will radically transform the world economy and that could also save the environment: nanotechnology, or more specifically, atomically precise manufacturing.&#x201d;<br><br><b><i>Nature Magazine</i></b><b>&#x201c;</b>Nanotechnology pioneer Eric Drexler bids us to leap in at the technological deep end. We can transform the way we make everything from bridges to circuit boards, he argues, by harnessing molecular machines that operate on digital principles. The result? Desktop or garage facilities that use less fuel, land and energy than today&#x2019;s vast factories and supply chains. The technical and political challenges of unleashing &#x2018;atomically precise manufacturing&#x2019; are substantial, but Drexler cuts deftly through the complexities.&#x201d;</p><h2>A Well-Regulated Militia: The Founding Fathers and the Origins of Gun Control in America</h2><p>Americans are deeply divided over the Second Amendment. Some passionately assert that the Amendment protects an individual's right to own guns. Others, that it does no more than protect the right of states to maintain militias. Now, in the first and only comprehensive history of this bitter controversy, Saul Cornell proves conclusively that both sides are wrong. <br> Cornell, a leading constitutional historian, shows that the Founders understood the right to bear arms as neither an individual nor a collective right, but as a civic right--an obligation citizens owed to the state to arm themselves so that they could participate in a well regulated militia. He shows how the modern "collective right" view of the Second Amendment, the one federal courts have accepted for over a hundred years, owes more to the Anti-Federalists than the Founders. Likewise, the modern "individual right" view emerged only in the nineteenth century. The modern debate, Cornell reveals, has its roots in the nineteenth century, during America's first and now largely forgotten gun violence crisis, when the earliest gun control laws were passed and the first cases on the right to bear arms came before the courts. Equally important, he describes how the gun control battle took on a new urgency during Reconstruction, when Republicans and Democrats clashed over the meaning of the right to bear arms and its connection to the Fourteenth Amendment. When the Democrats defeated the Republicans, it elevated the "collective rights" theory to preeminence and set the terms for constitutional debate over this issue for the next century. <br> <em>A Well-Regulated Militia</em> not only restores the lost meaning of the original Second Amendment, but it provides a clear historical road map that charts how we have arrived at our current impasse over guns. For anyone interested in understanding the great American gun debate, this is a must read.<br><br> Winner of the Langum Prize in American Legal History/Legal Biography</p><p><br><strong>Saul Cornell</strong> is Associate Professor of History at Ohio State University and Director of the Second Amendment Research Center at the John Glenn Institute. An authority on constitutional history and especially on the Second Amendment, he is the author of <em>The Other Founders: Anti-Federalism and the</em> <em>Dissenting Tradition in America</em> and editor of <em>Whose Right to Bear Arms Did the Second Amendment Protect</em>?<br><br>"Impressive and illuminating."--Cass R. Sunstein, <em>The New Republic</em><p></p><br>"This intelligent, carefully rendered history of gun policy in the United States...is challenging but essential reading for scholars, specialized undergraduates, and readers interested in law, criminal justice, and public affairs."--<em>Library Journal</em><p></p><br>"If proof were still needed that the study of the Second Amendment remains a fruitful source of inquiry, Saul Cornell's new book provides it. Crisply written and vigorously argued, <em>A Well-Regulated Militia</em> advances an often hackneyed debate by looking beyond the original concerns of the Revolutionary era. Cornell concisely demonstrates why so many of the contemporary fictions swirling around the meaning of this vexed clause depart from its real history."--Jack Rakove, author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning <em>Original Meanings</em><p></p><br>"Saul Cornell provides a wonderful, original treatment of a much discussed subject. Based on a meticulous review of American history, Cornell shows that both sides of the debate over the Second Amendment are mistaken. This is a must-read."--Erwin Chemerinsky, Duke University School of Law<p></p><br>"Jettisoning the rancorous partisanship and historical distortions of both advocates and opponents of gun control, Cornell recovers the lost civic dimension of the constitutional right to bear arms. The point of departure for any future, historically-informed discussion of this most controversial amendment, <em>A Well-Regulated Militia</em> clears the way for fresh and constructive thinking about the rights and responsibilities of gun ownership in America today."--Peter S. Onuf, author of <em>Jefferson's Empire: The Language of American Nationhood</em><p></p><br>"With this book Saul Cornell establishes himself as a leading interpreter of the Second Amendment, and teaches us valuable lessons not only about gun control and the militia, but about the nature of American republican government itself."--Stephen Presser, Northwestern University School of Law<p></p><br>"A provocative alternative in the debate over the historical meaning of the Second Amendment. Anyone interested in how the right to bear arms was thought about in the early republic will need to take this book into account." --Keith E. Whittington, author of <em>Constitutional Interpretation</em><p></p><br>" Well-Regulated Militia offers a much-needed examination of the varied notions of the right to bear arms that have prevailed at different moments in the history of the United States. Perhaps even more important, Cornell's study challenges the static conception that often dominates public discussion of this particular constitutional provision. By tracing the competing influences of the civic, states'-rights, individual-rights, and collective-rights theories of the role of arms in American society, Cornell reveals the often overlooked republican pairing of rights and duties that defined late-eighteenth-century gun ownership."--H-Net<p></p><br></p><h2>Jane Austen: Four Complete Novels: Sense and Sensibility / Pride and Prejudice / Emma / Northanger Abbey (Canterbury Classics)</h2><p>Having chosen to publish anonymously during her lifetime, Jane Austen is enjoying extraordinary fame and fortune today as a best-selling author.

He felt that achieving purity by avoiding meat and refraining from committing harm further promoted the pursuit of a peaceful life. Elements of the worship of Dionysus, such as shape-shifting and ritualistic ecstasy, were fused with Orphic beliefs to produce a powerful and illuminating new religion that found expression in the mystery cults. Practitioners of this new religion composed a great body of poetry, much of which is translated in <i>The Orphic Hymns</i>.</p><p>The hymns presented in this book were anonymously composed somewhere in Asia Minor, most likely in the middle of the third century AD. At this turbulent time, the Hellenic past was fighting for its survival, while the new Christian faith was spreading everywhere. <i>The Orphic Hymns</i> thus reflect a pious spirituality in the form of traditional literary conventions. The hymns themselves are devoted to specific divinities as well as to cosmic elements. Prefaced with offerings, strings of epithets invoke the various attributes of the divinity and prayers ask for peace and health to the initiate. Apostolos N. Athanassakis and Benjamin M. Wolkow have produced an accurate and elegant translation accompanied by rich commentary.</p></p><p><p>The best-selling English translation of the mysterious and cosmic Greek poetry known as the Orphic Hymns.</p><p><b>Apostolos N.

What kind of fruit these golden peaches really were cannot now be guessed, but they have the glamour of mystery, and they symbolize all the exotic things longed for, and unknown things hoped for, by the people of the T'ang empire.<br><br>This book examines the exotics imported into China during the T'ang Dynasty (A.D. 618-907), and depicts their influence on Chinese life. Into the land during the three centuries of T'ang came the natives of almost every nation of Asia, all bringing exotic wares either as gifts or as goods to be sold. Ivory, rare woods, drugs, diamonds, magicians, dancing girls&#x2015;the author covers all classes of unusual imports, their places of origin, their lore, their effort on costume, dwellings, diet, and on painting, sculpture, music, and poetry.<br><br>This book is not a statistical record of commercial imports and medieval trade, but rather a "humanistic essay, however material its subject matter."</p><p>Edward H. Schafer, until his untimely death in 1991, was Agassiz Professor of Oriental Languages at the University of California, Berkeley. His scholarship was devoted to the T&#39;ang dynasty, from the 8th to the 10th centuries, which saw the greatest cultural flowering in Chinese history. Relying on the literature of that period written by the Chinese themselves. Professor Schafer tried to reconstruct how they thought, dreamed, and regarded the world around them. His books, including The Vermilion Bird, Shore of Pearls, The Divine Woman, and Pacing the Void, brought the era to life for scholars, students, and general readers alike.

Among his fascinating findings is the work of amygdala structure within the brain. The amygdala mediates fear and other responses and actually processes information more quickly than other parts of the brain, allowing a rapid response that can save our lives before other parts of the brain have had a chance to react. He also offers findings and theories on how the brain handles--and in many cases, buries--extremely traumatic experiences. In all, a compelling read about the mysteries of emotions and the workings of the brain.<b>Joseph LeDoux</b> is the Henry and Lucy Moses Professor of Science in the Center for Neural Science at New York University.

This is not the same as &#x201c;doing math.&#x201d; The latter usually involves the application of formulas, procedures, and symbolic manipulations; mathematical thinking is a powerful <i>way of thinking</i> about things in the world -- logically, analytically, quantitatively, and with precision. It is not a natural way of thinking, but it can be learned. Mathematicians, scientists, and engineers need to &#x201c;do math,&#x201d; and it takes many years of college-level education to learn all that is required. Mathematical thinking is valuable to everyone, and can be mastered in about six weeks by anyone who has completed high school mathematics. Mathematical thinking does not have to be about mathematics at all, but parts of mathematics provide the ideal target domain to learn how to think that way, and that is the approach taken by this short but valuable book. The book is written <i>primarily</i> for first and second year students of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) at colleges and universities, and for high school students intending to study a STEM subject at university. Many students encounter difficulty going from high school math to college-level mathematics. Even if they did well at math in school, most are knocked off course for a while by the shift in emphasis, from the K-12 focus on mastering procedures to the &#x201c;mathematical thinking&#x201d; characteristic of much university mathematics. Though the majority survive the transition, many do not. To help them make the shift, colleges and universities often have a &#x201c;transition course.&#x201d; This book could serve as a textbook or a supplementary source for such a course. Because of the widespread applicability of mathematical thinking, however, the book has been kept short and written in an engaging style, to make it accessible to anyone who seeks to extend and improve their analytic thinking skills. Going beyond a basic grasp of analytic thinking that everyone can benefit from, the STEM student who truly masters mathematical thinking will find that college-level mathematics goes from being confusing, frustrating, and at times seemingly impossible, to making sense and being hard but <i>doable</i>.

With stunning poise and narrative verve, Manning explores how the Union and Confederate soldiers came to identify slavery as the central issue of the war and what that meant for a tumultuous nation. This is a brilliant and eye-opening debut and an invaluable addition to our understanding of the Civil War as it has never been rendered before.</p><p><b>Chandra Manning</b> graduated summa cum laude from Mount Holyoke College in 1993 and received a M.Phil from the National University of Ireland, Galway, in 1995. She took her Ph.D. at Harvard in 2002. She has lectured in history at Harvard and taught at Pacific Lutheran University in Tacoma, Washington. Currently, she is Assistant Professor of History at Georgetown University.&#x201c;The fact that slavery is the sole undeniable cause of this infamous rebellion, that it is a war of, by, and for Slavery, is as plain as the noon-day sun.&#x201d; [1] So claimed the farmers, shopkeepers, and laborers who made up the 13th Wisconsin Infantry in February 1862. The white Southerners who made up Morgan&#x2019;s Confederate Brigade might not have seen eye to eye with the Wisconsin men on much in 1862, but they agreed that &#x201c;any man who pretends to believe that this is not a war for the emancipation of the blacks . . . is either a fool or a liar.&#x201d; [2] Two years later, black men in the 14th Rhode Island Heavy Artillery reminded each other, &#x201c;upon your prowess, discipline, and character; depend the destinies of four millions of people and the triumph of the principles of freedom and self government of this great republic.&#x201d; [3] These soldiers plainly identified slavery as the root of the Civil War. Just as plainly, by &#x201c;slavery,&#x201d; they did not mean some abstract concept or a detached philosophical metaphor for ideas about freedom, but rather the actual enslavement of human beings in the United States based on race.Yet to say that soldiers placed slavery at the center of the war is to open rather than solve a mystery. Neither the authors nor intended audiences of these remarks held high office or made policy. Few owned slaves, and few of the white soldiers thought of themselves as abolitionists. They were instead very ordinary men of the type unlikely to figure into historical inquiries into the causes of the Civil War, and often assumed, even by historians from both the North and the South who for decades have acknowledged that without slavery there would have been no Civil War in the United States, to be little more than pawns swept up in events they probably did not understand, let alone consent to or shape. Members of the general public recognize even less of a connection between soldiers, slavery, and the Civil War. My most recent reminder of this sobering truism came at a wedding in September 2005 when a man from Buffalo, New York who had no idea what I do for a living spent more than an hour insisting that slavery had nothing to do with the conflict. And who can blame him? The Confederate ranks consisted primarily of men who owned no slaves, and historians have not convincingly explained why those men would fight a war they <i>knew</i> was waged to prevent the destruction of slavery. At the same time, scant numbers of the white men who filed into the Union Army had ever laid eyes on a slave, though most harbored their own prejudice against black people, so why would they fight to end slavery? And why would more than 180,000 black men fight for a government that had smiled on the enslavement of members of their race for its entire existence? What, in other words, did a &#x201c;war about slavery&#x201d; mean to the men who fought the Civil War, and why would it be important enough to fight?This book is about what ordinary soldiers thought about the relationship between slavery and the Civil War. It is not about soldiers&#x2019; motivations for enlisting, for individuals chose to do that for widely varied reasons. Seldom did a man enlist for money, since the pay was low and unreliable. Few joined the military because they were forced; both Union and Confederate armies overwhelmingly consisted of volunteers. Many enlisted out of senses of duty or personal honor. Some became soldiers in order to take part in what they assumed would be the biggest adventure of their lives. While some Northerners entered the ranks to eradicate slavery, others enlisted to preserve the Union with small concern for enslaved African Americans. In the South, many took up arms to safeguard their own slave property or their hopes to own slaves one day, while others shouldered rifles out of the belief that doing so protected their homes and families. Yet in spite of these and the countless other reasons that sent individual Northerners and Southerners into the ranks, broad consensus existed within each army as to why a war needing to be fought existed in the first place. Whatever else occupied their minds, ordinary Union and Confederate soldiers recognized slavery as the reason for the war, and the purpose of this book is to figure out why that was, and what it meant for the war and the nation.Most Confederate soldiers owned no slaves, and more than anything else in the world, they cared about the interests and well-being of their own families. Why, then, would an ordinary, non-slaveholding white southern man readily identify slavery as the reason for the war, and why would he consider it important enough to himself and his family to imperil both in a fight to prevent its abolition? Why would men continue to fight for four desperate years, through military catastrophes like Gettysburg and Atlanta and through political disasters like the re-election of President Abraham Lincoln, and then stop in the spring of 1865? Why would most white Northerners, who knew no black people, and who may or may not have viewed slavery as vaguely distasteful but certainly would not have sympathized with the antebellum abolitionist movement, care enough about an abstract concept like the &#x201c;Union&#x201d; to fight a war that, they, too, knew would never have happened if not for the institution of slavery? And if enlisted Union troops so vigorously opposed emancipation (as many historians and even more members of the general public, including the wedding guest from Buffalo, have long supposed), then why did the mass desertions predicted to occur in the wake of emancipation not happen? Did soldiers possess different attitudes toward slavery and its abolition than we have assumed? How did those attitudes compare to their ideas about racial equality and civil rights for black people? And how did the experiences of war and of interacting with black Americans (for the first time, in the case of many white Union soldiers) influence ordinary men&#x2019;s views? Black men who joined the Union ranks harbored few delusions about the United States&#x2019; long and complicated relationship to slavery or about white Northerners&#x2019; attitudes toward blacks. As the soldiers of the 14th Rhode Island Heavy Artillery pointed out, by 1860 slavery might have existed only in the southern states, but it still cast its &#x201c;baleful shadow over the whole land from Maine to Texas.&#x201d; Even after the war began, &#x201c;the North . . . despised the offer of her most loyal men&#x201d; and barred blacks from the Army. [4] Why would African American men struggle so determinedly to join an Army that at first refused them, and then once it did accept them, paid them less and prohibited them from becoming officers until the final year of the war? What did black troops expect the war and its aftermath to bring? This book departs from other books about Civil War soldiers because it places its primary focus on what soldiers thought about slavery. It does so because soldiers themselves did so. Rather than discussing slavery as one among many topics that soldiers addressed during the war, this book moves slavery from the periphery of soldiers&#x2019; mental worlds, where subsequent generations have tried to relegate it, and returns slavery to its rightful place at the center of soldiers&#x2019; views of the struggle. In so doing, it alters our view of the Civil War in several ways. It eliminates the need to explain away a war about slavery as either a war about something else or a war imposed on unwitting nonslaveholding soldiers (despite those soldiers&#x2019; own clear statements to the contrary) and instead helps unravel precisely <i>why</i> nonslaveholding Southerners would fight a war to protect slavery. Trying to understand why slavery mattered to the Confederate rank-and-file, rather than fabricating a view that we find more comforting or appealing, illuminates how and why enlisted Confederates held on as long as they did, and it also modifies our understanding of the timing of the war&#x2019;s end. Seeking to <i>understand</i>, rather than deny or assume, the centrality of slavery also sheds light on how 19th century Americans, especially Southerners, defined what it meant to be a man. While white Union soldiers did not articulate a clear relationship between slavery and manhood, white Southerners closely linked the two. A true man protected and controlled dependents, which for white Southerners meant that a man competently exercised mastery over blacks (whether or not he owned any) as well as over women and children. It also meant that a man took care of his family and sheltered his loved ones from harm, including the almost unimaginable harm that white Southerners feared emancipation would bring, because they assumed that slaves released from bondage would terrorize, murder, and violate vulnerable white women and children. Ironically, black Southerners (and even northern free blacks) also took for granted a relationship between slavery and manhood. For bondmen, the institution of slavery made true manhood impossible because it robbed a black man of the ability to protect his family from sale or to shelter his loved ones from violence or sexual violation at the hands of white masters. While slavery was necessary to white Southerners&#x2019; conception of manhood, in other words, it was antithetical to manhood among black men. Placing slavery at the center of soldiers&#x2019; ideas about the war also recasts much of what we know about white Union soldiers by providing a new understanding of <i>when</i> Union soldiers began to support emancipation, which in turn reveals a new emphasis on ordinary enlisted Union soldiers as agents of change who shaped the progress and outcome of the war. Few white Northerners initially joined the Union rank-and-file specifically to stamp out slavery, and most shared the anti-black prejudices common to their day, especially when the war began. Yet the shock of war itself and soldiers&#x2019; interactions with slaves, who in many cases were the first black people northern men had ever met, changed Union troops&#x2019; minds fast. At first, white Union soldiers had little trouble separating their ideas about slavery from their racist attitudes and saw no contradiction between demanding an end to slavery even while disputing any notion of black equality or opposing any suggestion of increased rights for black people. Yet as the war dragged on, even attitudes as stubborn as white Union troops&#x2019; anti-black prejudices shifted with the tide of the war, sometimes advancing and other times regressing. By the end of the war, white northern opinions about racial equality and civil rights, intractable though they had seemed in 1861, were far more malleable and vulnerable to intense self-scrutiny among Union troops than anyone could have imagined when the war first began. Attention to Union soldiers&#x2019; early shifts on slavery allows this book to enter . . . the conversation about how slavery ended. Some historians chiefly credit slaves themselves, who weakened the institution of slavery by their actions during the war, and who forced a war for Union to become a war against slavery by using their physical presence to make it impossible for Union Army Generals and political leaders like President Lincoln to ignore or shunt aside the question of slavery. [5] Other historians acknowledge individual slaves&#x2019; actions as instrumental in securing their own individual freedom (a slave who ran away to the Union Army did indeed free himself), but argue that ending the institution of slavery required the exercise of governmental power, and therefore President Abraham Lincoln, who issued and stuck with the Emancipation Proclamation and championed the Thirteenth Amendment (unlike his 1864 presidential opponent, George McClellan, who would have done neither) bears primary responsibility for destroying slavery in the United States. [6] This book argues that the enlisted men in the Union Army provided the crucial link between slaves and policy makers. Slaves themselves did force emancipation onto the Union agenda even when most white Northerners would have preferred to ignore it, but one of the most important and earliest ways they did so was by converting enlisted Union soldiers who, in 1861 and 1862 developed into emancipation advocates who expected their views to influence the prosecution of the war. Slaves convinced enlisted soldiers, who modified both their beliefs and their behavior. In turn, the men of the rank-and-file used letters, camp newspapers, and their own actions to influence the opinions of civilians and leaders who, lacking soldiers&#x2019; direct contact with slaves, the South, and the experience of living on the front lines in a war that most people wanted over, lagged behind soldiers in their stances on emancipation.To be sure, [soldiers] did not spend night and day thinking about the slavery issue, and most probably preferred to push it as far from the forefront of their minds as possible, but once the war came, they could not, and more importantly, <i>did not</i>, ignore it. Some historians have criticized (implicitly or explicitly) the study of Civil War soldiers as something of an escape hatch offering authors and readers a way to avoid wrestling with difficult and sometimes painful ideological questions about the war. [7] Even some veterans in their later years did their best to suppress the role of slavery, and even to deny that soldiers possessed any ideological awareness at all. Most famously, an aging Oliver Wendell Holmes, Junior sighed three decades after the end of the war, &#x201c;there is one thing I do not doubt . . . and that is that the faith is true and adorable which sends a soldier to throw away his life in obedience to a blindly accepted duty, in a cause which he little understands.&#x201d;[8] But that wistful sentimentalism flies in the face of much harder nosed reality that soldiers confronted during the war itself. If we listen to what soldiers had to say as they fought the Civil War, the men in the ranks do not allow us to duck the uncomfortable issue of human slavery, but rather take us right to the heart of it. They force us to look at it unflinchingly, and what is more, to see it as a <i>national</i>, not simply southern, issue that defined a war and shaped a nation. <b>Endnotes</b>[1] <i>The Wisconsin Volunteer</i>, Feb. 6, 1862, Leavenworth, KS, p. 3, KSHS. <i>The Wisconsin Volunteer</i> was the paper of the 13th WI.[2] <i>The Vidette</i> Nov. 2, 1862, Springfield, TN, p. 3, TSLA.

Author Gary Thomas does just that. And he reaches all the way back to the apostle Paul, who wrote that we need to prime our bodies to become, "an instrument for noble purposes, made holy, useful to the Master and prepared to do any good work." To illustrate the body/soul correlation, Thomas presents engaging and diverse stories that include a young mom who got fit through volleyball and reaped spiritual rewards in her marriage, a 300-pound pastor who realized his obesity was eroding his ministry impact, and a woman who gained the spiritual strength to survive a contentious divorce by training for a marathon. In every instance, Thomas makes a direct connection between the physical challenge and its spiritual consequence. This book is a must read for anyone seeking new and compelling motivation for strengthening their bodies and fortifying their souls.</p><p>Visit http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOJVmFwlYbA&nbsp;for more.</p></p><p><p>Gary Thomas is a writer in residence at Second Baptist Church in Houston, Texas, and an adjunct faculty member teaching on spiritual formation at Western Seminary in Portland, Oregon and Houston Theological Seminary in Houston, Texas.

Outrageous and charming, this not-so-dumb blonde has been portrayed on stage and screen by Carol Channing and Marilyn Monroe and has become the archetype of the footloose, good-hearted gold digger (not that she sees herself that way). Masquerading as her diaries, <em>Gentlemen Prefer Blondes</em> follows Lorelei as she entertains suitors across Europe before returning home to marry a millionaire. In this delightfully droll and witty book, Lorelei&#x2019;s glamorous pragmatism shines, as does Anita Loos&#x2019;s mastery of irony and dialect. A craze in its day and with ageless appeal, this new Liveright edition puts Lorelei back where she belongs: front and center.</p><p><p>Born in California, <strong>Anita Loos&nbsp;</strong>(1893&#x2013;1981) was herself a celebrity of the Jazz Age that produced Lorelei Lee.

It takes courage to live in a small wagon, traveling barely a hundred miles a week through Indian territory. But it takes a special out-of-the-ordinary courage to give up the dearest treasure of the heart. This is the story of Carolina Putnam, a New Hampshire girl who has to find out if she has the true spirit of a pioneer.</p><p>Elizabeth Yates is the author of sixteen novels and fifteen nonfiction books for the young. Among her many awards are the Newbery Medal, the William Allen White Children's Book Award, the Sarah Josepha Hale Award, and the Governor's Award of Distinction. Miss Yates grew up in a large farm family much interested in literature, theater, and life. She realized early that books not only should but also could "emphasize...some essential goodness," and many of her books spring from her experience and broad interests. In 1987, the New Hampshire House of Representatives saluted Miss Yates with an award for lifelong achievement. <p>Carolina's Courage came into being during the years that Miss Yates warmed the hearts of neighborhood children with Story Hour every Monday afternoon. A friend loaned her an Indian doll to show to the children, and she added to the story with a little old-fashioned doll named Lyddy-Lou.

A major&nbsp;&nbsp;work, filled with astute analysis and moving&nbsp;&nbsp;truths.</p><p>A rather thin volume that nevertheless will reassure adoptees that it is usual for questions about adoption and birth parents to persist throughout life. Using Erik Erikson's stages of life as a framework, Brodzinsky (Psychology/Rutgers) and Schechter (Psychiatry/Univ. of Pennsylvania), here writing with Henig (Your Premature Baby, 1983, etc.), call upon years of experience as researchers and counselors in the field of adoption to describe the continual adjustments that adoptees make as they grow from infancy to old age. Most moving is the litany of losses that move adoptees to grieve, often unknowingly. Even infants only a few months old show signs of mourning their first caretakers. Later, the authors say, adoptees may confront the loss not only of a birth family but of a personal and genetic history. The latter is particularly painful when it is time for young adults to begin their own families. Such life crises often kick off a search for birth parents. But the book's authority is undermined by what the authors frankly admit is the rapidly changing environment of adoption, where secrecy and shame are now rarely invoked and searches are often unnecessary. Open adoption-- in which the birth mother is known to and is often closely attached to the adoptive family--and increasingly available birth records eliminate the information gap that most often causes stress in adopted families (although open adoption may create its own set of stresses, the authors point out). Replete with anecdotal material, this offers few new insights but does lay out issues of development that only adoptees face over the course of life. -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP.

It is said a race of shapeshifters once lived here, only to perish when men came. But one man believes they can still be found, somewhere in the back of the beyond.</p><p>In <i>The Fifth Head of Cerberus,</i> Wolfe skillfully interweaves three bizarre tales to create a mesmerizing pattern: the harrowing account of the son of a mad genius who discovers his hideous heritage; a young man's mythic dreamquest for his darker half; the bizarre chronicle of a scientists' nightmarish imprisonment. Like an intricate, braided knot, the pattern at last unfolds to reveal astonishing truths about this strange and savage alien landscape.</p></p><p>A brothel keeper's sons discuss genocide and plot murder; a young alien wanderer is pursued by his shadow double; and a political prisoner tries to prove his identity, not least to himself. Gene Wolfe's first novel consists of three linked sections, all of them elegant broodings on identity, sameness, and strangeness, and all of them set on the vividly evoked colony worlds of Ste. Croix and Ste. Anne, twin planets delicately poised in mutual orbit. <p>Marsch, the victim in the third story, is the apparent author of the second and a casual visitor whose na�ve questions precipitate tragedy in the first. The sections dance around one another like the planets of their settings. Clones, downloaded personalities inhabiting robots, aliens that perhaps mimicked humans so successfully that they forgot who they were, a French culture adopted by its ruthless oppressors--there are lots of ways to lose yourself, and perhaps the worst is to think that freedom consists of owning other people, that identity is won at the expense of others. </p><p>It is easy to be impressed by the intellectual games of Wolfe's stunning book and forget that he is, and always has been, the most intensely moral of SF writers. <i>--Roz Kaveney, Amazon.co.uk</i></p><p><b>Gene Wolfe (1931-2019)</b> was the Nebula Award-winning author of The Book of the New Sun tetralogy in the Solar Cycle, as well as the World Fantasy Award winners <i>The Shadow of the Torturer</i> and <i>Soldier of Sidon</i>. He was also a prolific writer of distinguished short fiction, which has been collected in such award-winning volumes as <i>Storeys from the Old Hotel</i> and <i>The Best of Gene Wolfe</i>.</p><br><br><p>A recipient of the World Fantasy Award for Life Achievement, the Edward E.

The book includes more than 400 concise and acerbic entries, several essays, and a full topic index. Expanding on KILLING THE HOST: HOW FINANCIAL PARASITES AND DEBT DESTROY THE GLOBAL ECONOMY, Prof. Hudson&#x2019;s new book covers contemporary terms that are misleading or poorly understood as well as many important concepts that have been abandoned &#x2013; many on purpose &#x2013; from the long history of political economy.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Two key concepts are RENT THEORY and DEBT, which explain how Unearned Income and the Financial Sector impoverish governments and populations the world over as power and riches flow upward into the hands of the few. Several additional essays provide background for key points and explore today's uncertain political and economic environment.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; To understand what&#x2019;s really going on, it's not necessary to re-invent the wheel; the major issues that guide healthy economies were known to the Ancients and were expanded upon by the classical economists of the 18th and 19th centuries, including Adam Smith, David Ricardo, John Stuart Mill, E. Peshine Smith, Simon Patten, Karl Marx, Thorstein Veblen, and others of many political stripes whose aim was to leave the brutal legacy of feudalism behind. Their ideas and principles are brought back into the spotlight here. It is hoped that this book will deconstruct today's &#x201c;value-free," watered-down and deceptive economics that favor the wealthy, allowing the next generation to create a successful economy with proper checks and balances that will benefit everyone. This is a book you will&nbsp;want to refer&nbsp;to again and again.</p></p><p>Michael Hudson is a Distinguished Research Professor of Economics at the University of Missouri, Kansas City (UMKC), and Professor of Economics at Peking University in China.

There was nothing normal about the 2016 presidential election, not when senior U.S. officials were turning the surveillance powers of the federal government&#x2014;designed to stop terrorist attacks&#x2014;against the Republican presidential team. These were the ruthless tactics of a Soviet-style police state, not a democratic republic. The Red Thread asks the simple question: Why? What is it that motivated these anti-Trump conspirators from inside and around the Obama administration and Clinton networks to depart so drastically from &#x201c;politics as usual&#x201d; to participate in a seditious effort to overturn an election? Finding clues in an array of sources, Diana West uses her trademark investigative skills, honed in her dazzling work, American Betrayal, to construct a fascinating series of ideological profiles of well-known but little understood anti-Trump actors, from James Comey to Christopher Steele to Nellie Ohr, and the rest of the Fusion GPS team; from John Brennan to the numerous Clintonistas still patrolling the Washington Swamp after all these years, and more. Once, we knew these officials by august titles and reputation; after The Red Thread, readers will recognize their multi-generational and inter-connecting communist and socialist pedigrees, and see them for what they really are: foot-soldiers of the Left, deployed to take down America&#x2019;s first &#x201c;America First&#x201d; and most anti-Communist president. If we just give it a pull, the &#x201c;red thread&#x201d; is very long and very deep.</p><p></p><h2>Dental Public Health &amp; Research: Contemporary Practice for the Dental Hygienist</h2><p><i>Designed for community dental/public health courses, <b>Dental Public Health and Research </b>also serves as an ideal resource for board exam preparation or for dental hygiene practitioners.</i> <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br> <i> <i> <b>Dental Public Health and Research </b> </i> </i>explores the ever-changing world of dental public health&#x2013;a dynamic career pathway for dental hygienists&#x2013;and provides readers with the key tools needed to effectively practice and conduct dental hygiene in the public health setting.

Offering the finest examples from all reaches of the genre, this collection charts the mystery's eminent history from the turn-of-the-century puzzles of Futrelle, to the seminal pulp fiction of Hammett and Chandler, to the mystery story's rise to legitimacy in the popular mind, a trend that has benefited masterly writers like Westlake, Hunter, and Grafton. Nowhere else can readers find a more thorough, more engaging, more essential distillation of American crime fiction.<br> Penzler, the Best American Mystery Stories series editor, and Hillerman winnowed this select group out of a thousand stories, drawing on sources as diverse as Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine and Esquire, Collier's and The New Yorker. Giants of the genre abound -- Raymond Chandler, Stephen King, Dashiell Hammett, Lawrence Block, Ellery Queen, Sara Paretsky, and others -- but the editors also unearthed gems by luminaries rarely found in suspense anthologies: William Faulkner, John Steinbeck, Damon Runyon, Harlan Ellison, James Thurber, and Joyce Carol Oates. Mystery buffs and newcomers alike will delight in the thrilling stories and top-notch writing of a hundred years' worth of the finest suspense, crime, and mystery writing.</p><p>Anthologies are tricky things for editors: to select a story for inclusion is to make oneself a target for readers who wonder hotly why X or Y or Z <i>wasn't</i> chosen. And to be so brash as to deem an anthology the best <i>anything</i> of the century practically invites scorn and condemnation. But with <i>The Best American Mystery Stories of the Century</i>, Tony Hillerman, Edgar-winning author, and Otto Penzler, founder of the Mysterious Press, step boldly to the firing line with a salvo of 55 stories that are so devious and absorbing, challenging and rewarding that most readers will hold their fire.<p> The collection stretches from O. Henry's 1903 tale of a bank robber who abandons his trade ("A Retrieved Reformation") to Dennis Lehane's unsettling sketch of a post-Gothic southern town and its canine conundrum ("Running Out of Dog," 1999), and brings together authors who at first seem uneasy bedfellows. William Faulkner and Ernest Hemingway jostle for space with Donald Westlake and Stephen Greenleaf; Willa Cather and Flannery O'Conner stare combatively at Sara Paretsky and Sue Grafton. But as one reads along, these potentially tense alliances relax: the boundaries between "modern" and "classic," "pulp" and "literature" evanesce, leaving instead a shimmering web of serendipitous affiliations: O. Henry and Stephen King nod amiably to one another, united by the skill of their devious narrative twists. </p><p> Hillerman and Penzler's selections reflect a century-long shift in mystery fiction from an emphasis on an exterior landscape--replete with the tangible artifacts of who, what, where, when, how, why--to a growing interest in the geography of interiority. This landscape thrives on the amorphousness of its own features. In Tom Franklin's "Poachers," for example, the puzzle hardly matters at all: real people, and their endlessly convoluted relationships, do. Three orphaned brothers who live as predators in the swamps of the Gulf Coast, the old widower who loves them, the sheriff who pities them all--who kills two of the boys and blinds a third? We never really know. In any case, Franklin's infinitely shaded nuances of silence and speech matter far more than the violence of the crime itself.</p><p> And for those readers who, when all is read and done, still insist that <i>they</i> could have done a much better job of judging, Penzler's disarming editorial shrug serves to remind that any anthology should be approached with equanimity, a touch of resignation, and not a little humor: "There are no scientific instruments that can tell a reader which of Harlan Ellison's two Edgar-winning short stories is better. It is a coin toss, and it can't be anything else. Let's just live with it." Happily, <i>The Best American Mystery Stories of the Century</i> is an extraordinarily rewarding companion. <i>--Kelly Flynn</i></p>Tony Hillerman's many honors include the Mystery Writers of America's Edgar and Grandmaster prizes, the Silver Spur Award for best novel set in the West, and the Navajo Tribe's Special Friend Award.

Controversy has also long simmered over the full name of the "W.H." of the dedication. What is not in dispute is the superior quality of these lyrics, which rank among the finest sonnets ever written &#x2014; in any language.<br>Overt 150 poems deal with love, friendship, the tyranny of time, beauty's evanescence in power, death, and other themes in language unsurpassed in power, precision, and beauty. Now this inexpensive Dover edition enables any lover of poetry or fine literature to have this exquisite verse in his or her personal library.

Jonson's praise is especially prescient, since at the turn of the 17th century Shakespeare was but one of many popular London playwrights and none of his dramas were printed in his lifetime. The reason so many of his works survive is because two of his actor friends, with the assistance of Jonson, assembled and published the First Folio edition of 1623.</p>The Complete Sonnets is a handy resource for lovers of these poems. Recorded in consecutive order, with each actor reading in shifts of one or two sonnets, this production really does let the poem, in this case, be the thing. There&#39;s not much introduction before each sonnet besides the announcement of the next number. While it&#39;s nice to hear different readers deliver the poems, the transitions are, on occasion, jarring; one just settles into the timbre of a voice only to have it suddenly altered. Overall, the collection is a great resource and would make an excellent gift for a Shakespeare fan. R.A.P.

Drawing on unprecedented access to unexplored archives, plus Francis&#39;s own letters, Spoto places Francis within the context of the multifaceted ecclesiastical, political, and social forces of medieval Italy, casting new light on Francis and showing how his emphasis on charity as the heart of the Gospel&#39;s message helped him pioneer a new social movement. This nuanced portrait reveals the multifaceted character of a man who can genuinely be said to have changed the course of history.</p><p>Donald Spoto, author of <b>The Hidden Jesus</b>, taught theology, Christian mysticism, and biblical literature at the university level for twenty years. His other eighteen books include internationally bestselling biographies of Alfred Hitchcock, Laurence Olivier, Tennessee Williams, and Ingrid Bergman.It does not seem possible that the world needs another biography of St. Francis of Assisi, but Spoto (The Hidden Jesus) makes a credible case for adding to the glut of books and articles about the medieval saint. (Spoto cites one count taken nearly 40 years ago that puts the number at 1,575.) He argues that new discoveries in several fields and the latest Franciscan scholarship justify this new biography. Although the findings of his research required Spoto to strip away some of the romance surrounding Francis's familiar story, he manages to report them without detracting from the integrity of the saint. He raises, for example, questions about whether Francis actually bore the stigmata, or wounds of the crucified Christ, pointing out that sources interviewed for Francis's canonization denied that he had the marks. Spoto suggests that Francis may actually have suffered from leprosy and that his companions interpreted those wounds as a sharing in Christ's suffering. Spoto's chronological recounting of Francis's life is sufficiently engaging to retain the interest even of those familiar with the basic facts of the saint's story. Occasionally however, he lapses into seemingly misplaced preaching pedagogy, such as when he holds forth on the subject of conversion in a section about Francis's spiritual transformation- but given the saint's diverse appeal, this book should interest a wide audience.<br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Seeking Persephone</h2><p>When Persephone Lancaster receives a marriage proposal from the ill-tempered Duke of Kielder, she refuses, and then reconsiders. The obscene sum of money he&#39;s offering Persephone would save her family from ruin. With her characteristic optimism, she travels to the far reaches of Northumberland to wed a greatly feared stranger. Lodged deep in a thick forest infested with wild dogs, the Duke&#39;s castle is as cold and forbidding as the Duke himself, a man with terrible scars on his body and his soul. But the Duke&#39;s steely determination to protect his heart at all costs is challenged by his growing attachment to his lovely and gentle bride.

Croatia, quite simply, is blessed with some of the most spectacular scenery on the planet, and its history is&nbsp;equally captivating. <i>A Traveller's History of Croatia</i> offers tourists and travellers an inside look at how the country's&nbsp;cultural fusion of Mediterranean, Central European and Balkan influences has given it a tumultuous past. The book's narrative begins with Croatia's astounding Greek and Roman legacy, and then explains how the early blooming of the Croatian state in the 9th century was thwarted by the ambitions of its powerful neighbour, Hungary. In the Middle Ages much of the coast came under the control of Venice, which over centuries left its indelible stamp on many charming, historic towns. Croatia became a battlefield as the Ottoman Turks invaded during the 1500s, until they were finally repulsed by the Habsburgs, who ruled the country right up until the First World War. The twentieth century brought new solutions in the founding of Yugoslavia, problems with Croatian nationalism and the horrors of invasion in World War II. Under Tito a stability came to the region until the battles of the 1990s, which were finally resolved with the international recognition of an independent state in 1992.

Though her extant work consists only of a collection of fragments and a handful of complete poems, her mystique endures to be discovered anew by each generation, and to inspire new efforts at bringing the spirit of her Greek words faithfully into English. <br><br>In the past, translators have taken two basic approaches to Sappho: either very literally translating only the words in the fragments, or taking the liberty of reconstructing the missing parts. Willis Barnstone has taken a middle course, in which he remains faithful to the words of the fragments, only very judiciously filling in a word or phrase in cases where the meaning is obvious. This edition includes extensive notes and a special section of &#x201c;Testimonia&#x201d;: appreciations of Sappho in the words of ancient writers from Plato to Plutarch. Also included are a glossary of all the figures mentioned in the poems, and suggestions for further reading.</p><p>Born in Lewiston, Maine, Willis Barnstone was educated at Bowdoin, Columbia, the Sorbonne, and Yale. He taught in Greece at the end of the civil war (1949&#x2013;51), and in Buenos Aires during the Dirty War.

This is not only a vivid, sensuously elegant translation of every scrap of Sappho we have; the wonderful introduction is designed to increase our ardor as well as our knowledge, and the appendix containing everything the ancients said of her as well as poetic tributes up through Baudelaire&#x2019;s is itself a treasure.&#x201d;&#x2014;Alicia Ostriker, author of <i>No Heaven </i>and <i>Stealing the Language</i> <br><br>&#x201c;As a student I treasured the original Barnstone Sappho, and it is a joy to have this new version made current with the latest scholarship and enriched by four decades of further reflection. Sappho&#x2019;s famous voice is clear and powerful, even in the shards that remain to us, and Barnstone embraces and captures this phenomenon like no one else. This is a Sappho rendered with wisdom and heart for newcomers and connoisseurs alike.&#x201d;&#x2014;Jeffrey Henderson, Editor, Loeb Classical Library <br><br>&#x201c;What amazes me is how Sappho&#x2019;s lyrics, composed in the seventh century B.C.E., transcend their time and place to enchant us now. In lines that are at once passionate and precise, seemingly artless and yet magical, she writes of the cycles of life and death, and of erotic desire as a sacred calling. She looks into the burning center of things, and expresses pure wonder in the evening star, the moon, birdsong. Willis Barnstone&#x2019;s masterful translations capture her excited praise for the things of this world, making one of her prophetic observations shine with lasting truth: &#x2018;Someone, I tell you, in another time, / will remember us.&#x2019;&#x201d;&#x2014;Grace Schulman, author of <i>Days of Wonder</i> and <i>The Paintings of Our Lives</i> <br> <br>&#x201c;If there is any final justice, which there probably isn't, the world of letters would erect a monument of Willis Barnstone and strew it with fresh wildflowers every day. I think of this Sappho collection as the finest among Barnstone&#x2019;s prodigious achievements.&#x201d;&#x2014;Jim Harrison, author of <i>True North</i> and <i>Legends of the Fall</i> <br><br>&#x201c;Sappho knew that we never tire of learning: passion makes the moment eternal. Willis Barnstone has plumbed profound layers of the ancient Greek to bring us Sappho. On his way to her, he renewed the Gnostic Gospels and the Gospels proper. Now he has sounded the deepest lyric rock of our founding and given us new sound.&#x201d;&#x2014;Andrei Codrescu, NPR commentator and author of <i>It Was Today: New Poems</i> <br><br> &#x201c;Willis Barnstone has brought a life dedicated to translation and a lifetime of immersion in the Greek language to give us these new and inspired translations of Sappho. With its brilliant introduction and dazzling notes, this is the book of Sappho you will want on your bedside table.&#x201d;&#x2014;David St. John, author of <i>The Red Leaves of Night</i> <br><br>&#x201c;Eros has been riding Barnstone&#x2019;s back for years, whipping him across Spanish, French, Greek, Chinese poetry, across the poetry and prose of the biblical lands to translate from those literatures poetry, to make them new and his. Now he has embraced Sappho, with whom he has been in love for years. What he has made &#x2018;his&#x2019; is a gift to us. Barnstone&#x2014;lover, poet, and scholar&#x2014;cannot make Sappho&#x2019;s fragments whole, but he makes us more aware of our loss than any other translation. He gives us the abyss, and fragments of Sappho in startling English&#x2014;a few words that in ancient Greek changed its music and made the walls of the city tremble.&#x201d;&#x2014;Stanley Moss, author of <i>Asleep in the Garden</i><br>&#x201c;Although she lived on the Greek island of Lesbos in the seventh century B.C.E., the universal feelings that Sappho expressed still connect us, human to human, across the ages. It seems improbable that a new version of ancient writings could shed new light, but Barnstone&#x2019;s translation of Sappho does just that.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Booklist</i> <br><br>&#x201c;In the last few decades, there have been many translations of Sappho&#x2019;s work by gifted and well-meaning writers. None quite fills out these solitary, orphaned lines with the same rhythm and feeling. Barnstone is one of the greatest translators of literary expression from a foreign language into English. We are lucky to have him.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>New Letters</i></p><h2>Braided Bargello Quilts: Simple Process, Dynamic Designs * 16 Projects</h2><p>Grow your confidence with simple construction methods for advanced Bargello designs.

Faith in this philosophy subtly, yet assuredly undermines faith in the authority and infallibility of Scripture. In this Bible study resource, Dr. Henry Morris shines a bright light on the synchronicity between the Bible and modern science.</p> <p><strong>If the first eleven chapters of the Bible are considered allegory or myth, how will new and immature Christians relate to the Ten Commandments?</strong> Dr. Morris, the founder of the Institute for Creation Research, recognizes the attack on the foundational message of the Bible as Satan's long war against God. His professional scientific and biblical research is aimed at defeating the lies of evolution and defending the Bible.</p> <p><strong>The New Testament directly quotes or alludes to the Book of Genesis no less than 200 times,</strong> with half of these referring to the first 11 chapters of Genesis. Jesus Christ quoted or referred to each of the first 7 chapters of Genesis alone. All of these references show that both Christ and the apostles accepted Genesis not only as fully historical but also as divinely inspired.</p> <p><strong><em>The Beginning of the World</em> offers careful analysis of following topics</strong> and many more revealing their relevance and/or application to our 21st century lives.</p> <ul> <li>The fallacies of Evolution</li> <li>The Meaning of Marriage</li> <li>The Giants in the earth</li> <li>The Geological Implications of the Flood</li> <li>The Noahic Covenant</li> <li>The Table of Nations</li> <li>Nimrod and the Tower of Babel</li> </ul> <p><strong>If you love the Bible but experience difficulty in defending it against intellectual arguments, you will find this Bible study resource extremely helpful.</strong> Perhaps Dr. Morris writes to help you and your church withstand the academic attack and ridicule of the Christian faith by supplying a solid and intelligent knowledge of the complete integrity of Genesis. This book is an excellent study aid for Bible teachers, Bible study groups, and individual study by both scholars and laymen. Discussion questions are offered at the end of each chapter.</p></p><p>Evolution is a scientific fairy tale just as the "flat earth theory" was in the 12th century.

He lives in Massachusetts with his family. Learn more at pigeonpresents.com.PreSchool-Grade 3&#x2013;This painless introduction to good manners is sure to produce a generation of more civilized beings. With tongue firmly in cheek, Willems uses an army of mice and a cast of multicultural children to cover the basics of polite conversation: please, excuse me, sorry, and thank you. The tiny rodents are responsible for maneuvering the colorful text bubbles (and parachutes, arrows, signs, hot-air balloons, sails, wrecking balls, etc.). Framing the words in creative ways against expansive white backgrounds reinforces their importance while providing a boost to beginning readers. The examples speak directly to a young child's experience, thereby inspiring the motivation to try the author's suggestions: If you ever really want something&#x2013;the illustration shows an entranced girl eyeing a cookie jar&#x2013;...don't just grab it! Go ask a big person and please say please'! Other relevant situations follow as the mice instruct and cajole the youngsters on the art of approaching adults while remaining sincere. A certain pigeon makes a cameo appearance, and a simple board game decorates the endpapers. While treatises on good manners abound, this entertaining and practical guide is closest to the spirited style of Sesyle Joslin's <i>What Do You Say, Dear</i>? (HarperCollins, 1958). Willems offers no sermons, no sentimentality, just good sense&#x2013;and fun, thank you very much.<i>&#x2013;Wendy Lukehart, Washington DC Public Library</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

But the GhostWalker wasn&#x2019;t there for a good time. He was looking for <i>her</i>. Cayenne. It&#x2019;s where she found her victims. Poor suckers. Then again, who wouldn&#x2019;t want to leave a place like this with a woman like her?<br><br>It&#x2019;s not Cayenne&#x2019;s fault. Locked up, experimented on and never knowing kindness, she was bred this way&#x2014;with a heart of pure venom. Trap understands her. He survived his own dark past and he shares her desire for getting even. But now Trap&#x2019;s greatest danger is Cayenne herself. Because what&#x2019;s inside her is hard to control&#x2014;especially when it&#x2019;s aroused by a lover as reckless as Trap.</p><p><b>Christine Feehan</b> is the #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of the Carpathian series, the GhostWalker series, the Leopard series, the Shadow Riders series, and the Sea Haven novels, including the Drake Sisters series and the Sisters of the Heart series.<b><p>Chapter One</p></b><br><p>Trap Dawkins sighed as he tilted his chair on two legs, automatically calculating the precise angle and vector he could tip before he fell over. He was bored out of his fucking mind. This was the fifth night in a row he&#x2019;d come to the Huracan Club, a Cajun bar out in the middle of the fucking swamp for God&#x2019;s sake. Peanut husks covered the bar and round, handmade wooden tables with a crude variety of chairs covered the floor. The bar was constructed of simple planks of wood set on sawhorses surrounded by high stools also hand carved.</p><p>To the left of the bar was a shiny beautifully kept baby grand piano. In the bar that was mostly a shack out in the middle of nowhere, the piano looked totally out of place. The lid was open and there wasn&#x2019;t a dust spot&#x2014;or a scratch&#x2014;on the instrument. It was also completely in tune. The piano sat on a raised dais with two long steps made of hardwood leading up to it. There were no peanut husks on the platform or on the stairs. Everyone who frequented the bar knew not to touch the piano unless they really knew how to play. No one would dare. The piano had gone unscathed through hundreds of bar fights that included knives and broken bottles.</p><p>Trap glanced at the piano. He supposed he could play. Sometimes that helped his mind stay calm when it needed action. He couldn&#x2019;t take sitting for hours doing nothing. How did these people do it? That question had occupied his brain for all of two minutes. He didn&#x2019;t really care why they did it, or how, it was just plain a waste of time. He wasn&#x2019;t certain he could take much more of this, but on the other hand, what alternative was there?</p><p>He&#x2019;d come looking for her. Cayenne. In spite of the fact that no one could accurately describe her, Trap knew she frequented the bar. This was where she chose her victims. The robberies in the swamp were only rumors, whispers, the men too embarrassed to say much. They were always drunk. Always on their way home. They were men with bad reputations, men others steered clear of. She would choose those men and they wouldn&#x2019;t be able to resist her. Not her looks. Not her voice. Not the lure she used.</p><p>He sighed again and glanced toward the bar, wishing he had another beer, but seriously, it was nearly one in the morning. She wasn&#x2019;t coming. He would have to endure this nightmare again.</p><p>&#x201c;Fuck,&#x201d; he whispered crudely, under his breath. He had discipline and control in abundance. But he couldn&#x2019;t stop himself from the destructive path he was set on. He had to find her, and that meant coming to this hellhole every night until he did.</p><p>&#x201c;How you doin&#x2019;, Trap?&#x201d; Wyatt Fontenot asked, as he put a fresh bottle of beer on the very rickety table in front of his fellow GhostWalker and toed a chair out so he could straddle it. &#x201c;You ready to leave? You&#x2019;re lookin&#x2019; like you might be startin&#x2019; a fight any minute.&#x201d;</p><p>Trap would never, under any circumstances start a fight. But he&#x2019;d finish it, and he&#x2019;d do that in a very permanent way. That was why half their team came to the bar with him.</p><p>&#x201c;Can&#x2019;t leave,&#x201d; Trap said. Low. Decisive.</p><p>Not that he didn&#x2019;t want to leave, Wyatt noted. Trap said can&#x2019;t. There was a big difference. He&#x2019;d told Wyatt he was looking for Cayenne, the woman he&#x2019;d rescued from certain death, but knowing Trap, that was so far out of his reality that Wyatt hadn&#x2019;t really believed him. But now . . .</p><p>"Trap.&#x201d; Wyatt kept his voice low. Steady. His gaze on one of his closest friends.</p><p>Trap was a very dangerous man. He didn&#x2019;t look it, sitting there, legs sprawled out in front of him, his chair tipped back and his eyes half closed, but there was ice water running in his veins. More, he had a brain that worked overtime, calculating everything even as he observed the minutest detail of his surroundings.</p><p>He had a steady hand and the eyes of an eagle. He was silent and deadly when he stalked an enemy, and he was known to go into an enemy camp alone, death drifting in and the reaper drifting back out. He killed without a sound and thoroughly, taking out the enemy without raising an alarm. When he returned, he was the same exact man&#x2014;cool and remote, his brain already moving on to solve another problem.</p><p>Trap raised those piercing glacier-cold eyes to his. An icy shiver crept down Wyatt&#x2019;s spine.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve known you for years,&#x201d; Wyatt continued. &#x201c;You get caught up in problems, Trap. Problems that need solvin&#x2019;. Your brain just won&#x2019; let it go. This woman is a problem. That&#x2019;s what this is.&#x201d;</p><p>Trap sighed. &#x201c;You know better. You, of all people know better.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You don&#x2019; become obsessed with women. Hell, Trap, you hook up for an hour or two and then you walk. Not a night. An hour or two at the most.&#x201d;</p><p>Trap didn&#x2019;t deny it. &#x201c;I fuck &#x2019;em and then walk away because I don&#x2019;t need the entanglement but I need the release.&#x201d; He stated the fact mildly. Unashamed. Uncaring.</p><p>&#x201c;This woman is a problem to solve to you. That&#x2019;s all she is. This has nothin&#x2019; to do with the woman herself, just the mystery of her. You have to know that.&#x201d; Wyatt&#x2019;s Cajun accent was becoming more noticeable, the only thing that betrayed his wariness.</p><p>Trap&#x2019;s expression didn&#x2019;t change. His icy gaze didn&#x2019;t leave Wyatt&#x2019;s face as he took a long pull on the beer and set it down. &#x201c;You grew up in that family of yours Wyatt. You got your grandmother. Sweet and kind. You had all this.&#x201d; He gestured toward the swamp where Wyatt had grown up. &#x201c;Running wild. Living a life. Having a family. You know what that&#x2019;s like.&#x201d;</p><p>Wyatt remained silent. Trap never talked about his past. Not ever. They&#x2019;d met in college when they were both still teens and worked together on numerous projects that made both of them very wealthy. Wyatt had joined the service, and ultimately the GhostWalker psychically enhanced Special Forces unit. Trap had followed.</p><p>In the years they&#x2019;d known each other, Trap had never once alluded to his past. He sounded like he was gearing up to do just that, and Wyatt wasn&#x2019;t about to blow the opportunity to learn more about what had made his friend as cold as ice. He simply nodded, keeping his gaze just as steady on Trap&#x2019;s, mesmerized by the blue flame that burned ice-cold under the glacier.</p><p>&#x201c;I had two sisters and a brother. Did I ever tell you that?&#x201d; Trap&#x2019;s fist tightened around the neck of the beer bottle, but he didn&#x2019;t lift it to his mouth. &#x201c;My name wasn&#x2019;t Dawkins back then when I had them. It was Johansson.&#x201d; He said the name like there was a bad taste in his mouth. &#x201c;Changed it legally in order to keep that shit out of the spotlight. To keep my enemies from finding me. Didn&#x2019;t work with the enemies, but it did with the press.&#x201d;</p><p>Had. Wyatt&#x2019;s heart clenched hard in his chest. He regarded Trap as a brother. He had for years. He shook his head slowly. What kid had enemies they had to hide from? Enemies so dangerous they needed a name change? Wyatt remained silent. Waiting. Letting Trap take his time.</p><p>&#x201c;My brother, Brad, and my sister Linnie were younger than me by a couple of years. Drusilla was older by a couple of years. Dru took care of us while our mother worked. She worked because our father didn&#x2019;t.&#x201d; He raised the bottle to his mouth and took a long pull. Through it, his eyes didn&#x2019;t leave Wyatt&#x2019;s.</p><p>Dread built. This was going to be bad. Really bad. Many of the GhostWalkers had difficult lives, which was probably why they made the military their home, but Wyatt knew the hell that was there under all that ice, those blue flames that burned white-hot and glacier-cold, meant whatever had happened to Trap was going to be bad.</p><p>He felt movement behind him and knew Mordichai, another GhostWalker and member of their team, was coming up behind him. He dropped his hand low, down by the side of the chair and waved him off, counting on Mordichai to understand&#x2014;to know not to come near the table or allow anyone else to.</p><p>&#x201c;My father despised me. I was different, even then, even as a child. He wasn&#x2019;t in the least bit logical and half the time he didn&#x2019;t make sense. He hated the very sight of me, and Dru took to stepping in front of me when he was around, because the moment he laid eyes on me, he had to beat the holy hell out of me.&#x201d;</p><p>Trap shrugged, the movement casual. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t understand what I did wrong, and poor Dru tried her best to shield me. I was so young, but already too old in my mind.&#x201d;</p><p>Wyatt understood that. Trap rivaled some of the greatest IQs in history. Wyatt was intelligent, but like many others he was especially gifted in certain areas. Trap was just plain gifted at everything. Along with the brains, he had the fast reflexes and superb body of a warrior.</p><p>&#x201c;My father wasn&#x2019;t proud of me for being gifted. If anything, he took it as an affront. Dru always said he felt threatened by me, but I was a little kid and I didn&#x2019;t see how I was a threat to him.&#x201d;</p><p>Wyatt didn&#x2019;t make the mistake of letting compassion or anger show in his expression. Trap would close down immediately. Trap kept his emotions under tight control and Wyatt realized why. There was rage coiled deep. So deep that it was never&#x2014;ever&#x2014;going to be purged.</p><p>&#x201c;We never told mom about the beatings, but one day she saw the bruises and the swelling. He&#x2019;d broken my arm and a couple of ribs. She took me to the hospital, and he was arrested. While he was in jail, she packed us up and moved us out of the city. I was eight. Dru, ten. We went clear across the country. His family bailed him out. He had two brothers, both as worthless and as vicious as he was.&#x201d;</p><p>The chair never moved, remaining balanced on two legs as Trap took another long pull of his beer. He put the bottle down with deceptive gentleness on the table. The movement was precise and deliberate. Just like Trap. Just like everything Trap did.</p><p>&#x201c;They found us when I was nine. My father came into the house late at night while his two brothers, poured gasoline up and down the walls inside and outside the little house we rented. He dragged my mother out of bed, down to the room where my little brother and sister slept. He shot them both and then shot Mom in the head.&#x201d;</p><p>Trap&#x2019;s expression didn&#x2019;t change. His tone didn&#x2019;t change. He might have been reciting a story he&#x2019;d read in the papers. Wyatt&#x2019;s fist clenched beneath the rickety table, but he didn&#x2019;t allow his expression to change either.</p><p>&#x201c;Dru and I were talking together in our secret hideaway. When we first moved in, we found a closet that was really shallow and after Mom went to bed, we&#x2019;d sometimes get up and read or discuss something interesting we&#x2019;d learned that day. We heard the shots and we went to find Mom, to see what was going on. Dru threw herself in front of me when he came at us. He shot her twice and her body landed on top of me. I could see her eyes, Wyatt. Wide open. Blank. She had beautiful eyes, but all of sudden, there was no light. No brilliance. My beautiful sister, so smart, so funny, the only one who could relate to me, who really saw me, saw into me, was dead. Gone. Just like that.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Fuck, Trap,&#x201d; Wyatt said softly. What else was there to say? This was far worse than anything he had imagined.</p><p>&#x201c;He should have just shot me,&#x201d; Trap said softly, almost as if he was talking to himself. &#x201c;If he had any intelligence at all, he would have just shot me like he did Dru. She was so smart, Wyatt. A gift to the world. She could have done things, but he took her life for no reason other than he was a fucked-up asshole.&#x201d;</p><p>Still, even with the language, there was no change in Trap&#x2019;s voice. None. That rage was buried so deep, so much a part of him, Wyatt doubted he actually knew it was there anymore. He held up two fingers, knowing Mordichai was watching them closely. Most likely the other members of his team were doing the same, not knowing what was going on, but willing to help in any way they could.</p><p>The GhostWalkers who had come with them were spread throughout the bar, one sitting on a barstool, one lounging by the famous piano the owner of the Huracan Club, Delmar Thibodeaux, guarded with a baseball bat, and a couple of others sitting at table across the room. All would be watching Trap&#x2019;s and Wyatt&#x2019;s backs, and at same time appearing as if they had no cares in the world.</p><p>Neither man spoke until Mordichai plopped two icy cold bottles of beer on the table and sauntered away, pretending like all the team members were that he had no clue Trap and Wyatt were in a nightmarish discussion.</p><p>&#x201c;How&#x2019;d you stay alive?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He dragged me out from under Dru. I think he wanted to beat me before he shot me, but as I came up I rammed my head into his groin and twisted the gun from his hand as he went down. I&#x2019;d already calculated the odds of success and knew I had a good chance. I shot him twice before he was on me. He had a knife in his boot.&#x201d;</p><p>Wyatt had seen the wicked scar that seemed to take up half of Trap&#x2019;s belly. He&#x2019;d been what? Nine, he&#x2019;d said. His own father had wiped out his family, killing his mother and brother and sisters. Wyatt pushed down the rage swirling deep in his gut. He drew in a deep breath to keep from annihilating the room. The peanut husks on the floor jumped several times like popcorn in a popper and the walls of the bar shimmered and breathed in and out. He took several breaths to get himself under control.</p><p>&#x201c;He stabbed me twice. Once in my belly and again in my thigh. I hung on to that gun, but I went down in all the blood. That&#x2019;s when my uncles came in. They came at me, but I lifted the gun and both backed off fast. I guess they were either cowards or they knew my father was done for, because they left him there bleeding out, threw gasoline all over the floor, lit a match and told me to burn in hell. They got out. I crawled out. Still got the scars on my legs and feet from the burns.&#x201d;</p><p>Wyatt clenched his teeth and then carefully brought the bottle to his mouth. He needed action. Something. He almost wished a fight would break out as they habitually did in the bar. When he was younger, he often came there to drink, fight and find a woman, just like most of the other men in the swamp and bayou did. Now he came to drink and fight. He had a woman waiting for him at home.</p><p>&#x201c;I had one living relative, my mother&#x2019;s sister. She was fifteen years younger than mom, barely twenty-three, and single, but she came and got me and I lived with her. We changed our names, moved and thought we were going to be all right. At twelve I founded my first company after selling two of my patents. We lived good for a while.&#x201d;</p><p>For the first time something moved in his cold, piercing eyes. Trap raked his hand through his blond hair, hair that definitely identified him as an outsider there in Cajun country. Had he not been with Wyatt, he would have been the first target chosen for anyone looking for a fight. The fight wouldn&#x2019;t have ended well. Trap wasn&#x2019;t a man who enjoyed a good friendly brawl. You didn&#x2019;t put your hands on him. You didn&#x2019;t threaten him. Even there in the Huracan Club with his team around him, he kept to himself. Wyatt could see the name Johansson suited Trap far better than Dawkins. Trap definitely had some Swede in him, with his build and blond hair.</p><p>Wyatt didn&#x2019;t want to hear what happened to Trap&#x2019;s aunt, but he had to know. There were too many flames burning icy hot behind the blue glacier of Trap&#x2019;s eyes.</p><p>&#x201c;For a while?&#x201d; he prompted.</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah. For a while. I made a lot of mon...</p></p><h2>Climbing Free: My Life in the Vertical World</h2><p><p><strong>The legendary rock climber who redefined the boundaries of her sport tells her story.</strong></p><p>From the age of thirteen when she began climbing, it was clear Lynn Hill had an unusual gift. Before long she was arguably the best rock climber in the world, establishing routes so bold and difficult that few others could follow. And in 1994, Lynn succeeded on a climb that no one&#x2015;man or woman&#x2015;has been able to repeat: the first "free ascent" of the Nose on Yosemite's El Capitan, which means that she climbed 3,000 feet of vertical granite without using gear to aid her ascent&#x2015;and all in under twenty-three hours. In <em>Climbing Free</em> Hill describes her famous climb and meditates on how she harnesses the strength and the courage to push herself to such extremes. She tells of her near-fatal 80-foot fall, her youth as a stunt artist for Hollywood, her friendships with climbing's most colorful personalities, and the tragedies and triumphs of her life in the vertical world. More than merely a story of adventure, this book stands out as a genuine, singular account of a life richly and boldly lived.</p> 32 pages of color photographs, 35 black-and-white photographs</p><p><p><strong>Lynn Hill</strong> has been featured in <em>Life, Vanity Fair, Outside, Time, National Geographic,</em> and in the IMAX film <em>Extreme</em>. She lives in Moab, Utah.</p><p><strong>Greg Child</strong> is a world-class mountaineer and the author of several books on climbing. He lives near Moab, Utah.</p>Hill began climbing when she was 14, in 1970, scampering up a rock face while her companions turned away in exhaustion; by 1994, she had done something no other climber had ever done: made a free ascent of El Capitan's hideously challenging Nose. That's 3,000 feet of granite, straight up. This autobiography, written with veteran climber and author Child, is a must-read for fans of sport climbing (which is very different, Hill explains, from mountaineering). Naturally, she hits all the high spots in a career filled with them: El Capitan and Joshua Tree in Yosemite National Park, Granite Mountain in Arizona, Nevada's Heart of Darkness, the Gunks in New Jersey, and the ominously named Suicide Rocks in California. Hill has climbed them all, and plenty more. In the world of sport climbing, she's a superstar, and yet, unlike many autobiographies written by superstars, this book contains not a trace of ego or pretension. She is an ordinary person with an extraordinary gift; her story, which could have been aggressively self-promoting, is instead quietly inspiring. <i>David Pitt</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

I couldn&#x2019;t help closing my eyes for a moment to appreciate its layered fragrance drifting on the light morning breeze. Spanish lavender, or &#x201c;topped&#x201d; lavender&#x2014;according to my gamma, it had been one of my mother&#x2019;s favorites. It was a flower that had instilled calm and soothed the skin for time eternal, a humble herb still used to ease headache and heartache alike. I remembered Gamma murmuring to me in her garden when I was five years old:</p><p><i>Breathe deeply, Elliana. Notice how you can actually taste the scent when you inhale it? Pliny the Elder brewed this into his spiced wine, and Romans used it to flavor their ancient sauces. In the language of flowers, it signifies the acknowledgment of love.</i></p><p>Not that I&#x2019;d be using it in that capacity anytime soon.</p><p>But Gamma had been gone for over twenty years, and my mother had died when I was only four. Shaking my head, I returned my attention to the tiny mosaic pathway next to where I knelt. Carefully, I added a piece of foggy sea glass to the design. The path was three feet long and four inches wide, and led from beneath a tumble of forget-me-nots to a violet-colored fairy door set into the base of the east fence. Some people referred to them as &#x201c;gnome doors,&#x201d; but whatever you called them, the decorative miniature garden phenomena were gaining popularity with adults and children alike. The soft green and blue of the water-polished, glass-nugget path seemed to morph directly from the clusters of azure flowers, curving around a lichen-covered rock to the ten-inch round door. I wondered how long it would take one of my customers to notice this new addition to the verdant garden behind my perfume and aromatherapy shop, Scents &amp; Nonsense.</p><p>The rattle of the latch on the gate to my left interrupted my thoughts. Surprised, I looked up and saw Dash trotting toward me on his short corgi legs. His lips pulled back in a grin as he reached my side, and I smoothed the thick ruff of fur around his foxy face. Astrid Moneypenny&#x2014;my best friend in Poppyville, or anywhere else, for that matter&#x2014;strode behind him at a more sedate pace. Her latest foster dog, Tally, a Newfoundland mix with a graying muzzle, lumbered beside her.</p><p>&#x201c;Hey, Ellie! There was a customer waiting on the boardwalk out front,&#x201d; Astrid said. &#x201c;I let her in to look around. Tally, sit.&#x201d;</p><p>I bolted to my feet, the fairy path forgotten. &#x201c;Oh, no. I totally lost track of time. Is it already ten o&#x2019;clock?&#x201d;</p><p>The skin around Astrid&#x2019;s willow-green eyes crinkled in a smile. They were a startling contrast to her auburn hair and freckled nose. &#x201c;Relax. I&#x2019;ll watch the shop while you get cleaned up.&#x201d; She jammed her hand into the pocket of her hemp dress and pulled out a cookie wrapped in a napkin. &#x201c;Snickerdoodles today.&#x201d;</p><p>I took it and inhaled the buttery cinnamon goodness. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re the best.&#x201d;</p><p>Astrid grinned. &#x201c;I have a couple of hours before my next gig. Tally can hang out here with Dash.&#x201d; She was a part-time technician at the veterinary clinic and a self-proclaimed petrepreneur&#x2014;dog walker and pet sitter specializing in animals with medical needs. &#x201c;But isn&#x2019;t Josie supposed to be working today?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She should be here soon,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;She called last night and left a message that she might be late. Something about a morning hike to take pictures of the wildflowers.&#x201d; I began gathering pruners and trowel, kneeling pad and weed digger into a handled basket. &#x201c;They say things are blooming like crazy in the foothills right now.&#x201d;</p><p>Astrid turned to go, then stopped. Her eyes caught mine. &#x201c;Ellie&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;</p><p>She shook her head. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s just that you look so happy working out here.&#x201d;</p><p>I took in the leafy greenery, the scarlet roses climbing the north fence, tiered beds that overflowed with herbs and scented blooms, and the miniature gardens and doors tucked into surprising nooks and alcoves. A downy woodpecker rapped against the trunk of the oak at the rear of the lot, and two hummingbirds whizzed by on their way to drink from the handblown glass feeder near the back patio of Scents &amp; Nonsense. An asymmetrical boulder hunkered in the middle of the yard, the words ENCHANTED GARDEN etched into it by a local stone carver. He&#x2019;d also carved words into river rocks I&#x2019;d placed in snug crannies throughout the half-acre space. The one next to where Dash had flopped down read BELIEVE. Mismatched rocking chairs on the patio, along with the porch swing hanging from the pergola, offered opportunities for customers to sit back, relax, sip a cup of tea or coffee, and nibble on the cookies Astrid baked up each morning.</p><p>&#x201c;I am happy,&#x201d; I said quietly. More than that. <i>Grateful.</i> A sense of contentment settled deep into my bones, and my smile broadened.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m glad things have worked out so well for you.&#x201d; Her smile held affection that warmed me in spite of the cool morning.</p><p>&#x201c;It hasn&#x2019;t been easy, but it&#x2019;s true that time smooths a lot of rough edges.&#x201d; I rolled my eyes. &#x201c;Of course, it&#x2019;s taken me nearly a year.&#x201d;</p><p>A year of letting my heart heal from the bruises of infidelity, of divorce, of everyone in town knowing my&#x2014;and my ex&#x2019;s&#x2014;business. In fact, perfect clich� that it was, everyone except me seemed to know Harris had been having an affair with Wanda Simmons, the owner of one of Poppyville&#x2019;s ubiquitous souvenir shops. Once I was out of the picture, though, he&#x2019;d turned the full spectrum of his demanding personality on her. She&#x2019;d bolted within weeks, going so far as to move back to her hometown in Texas. I still couldn&#x2019;t decide whether that was funny or sad.</p><p>I&#x2019;d held my ground, however. Poppyville, California, nestled near the foothills of the Sierra Nevada Mountains, was <i>my</i> hometown, and I wasn&#x2019;t about to leave. The town&#x2019;s history reached back to the gold rush, and tourists flocked to its Old West style; its easy access to outdoor activities like hiking, biking, and fly fishing; and to the small hot spring a few miles to the south.</p><p>After the divorce, I&#x2019;d purchased a storefront with the money Harris paid to buy me out of our restaurant, the Roux Grill. The property was perfect for what I wanted: a retail store to cater to townspeople and tourists alike and a business that would allow me to pursue my passion for all things scentual. Add in the unexpected&#x2014;and largely free&#x2014;living space included in the deal, and I couldn&#x2019;t turn it down.</p><p>Sense &amp; Nonsense was in a much sought after location at the end of Corona Street&#x2019;s parade of bric-a-brac dens. The kite shop was next door to the north, but to the south, Raven Creek Park marked the edge of town with a rambling green space punctuated with playground equipment, picnic tables, and a fitness trail. The facade of my store had an inviting, cottagelike feel, with painted shutters above bright window boxes and a rooster weathervane twirling on the peaked roof. The acre lot extended in a rectangle behind the business to the front door of my small-scale home, which snugged up against the back property line.</p><p>With a lot of work and plenty of advice from local nurserywoman Thea Nelson, I&#x2019;d transformed what had started as a barren, empty lot between the two structures into an elaborate garden open to my customers, friends, and the occasional catered event. As I&#x2019;d added more and more whimsical details, word of the Enchanted Garden had spread. I loved sharing it with others, and it was good for business, too.</p><p>&#x201c;Well, it&#x2019;s nice to have you back, sweetie. Now we just have to find a man for you.&#x201d; Astrid reached down to stroke Tally&#x2019;s neck. The big dog gazed up at her with adoration, while I struggled to keep a look of horror off my face.</p><p>&#x201c;Man?&#x201d; I heard myself squeak. That was the last thing on my mind. Well, almost. I cleared my throat. &#x201c;What about your love life?&#x201d; I managed in a more normal tone.</p><p>She snorted. &#x201c;I have plenty of men, Ellie. Don&#x2019;t you worry about me.&#x201d;</p><p>It was true. Astrid attracted men like milkweed attracted monarch butterflies. At thirty-seven, she&#x2019;d never been married, and seemed determined to keep it that way.</p><p>&#x201c;Astrid,&#x201d; I began, but she&#x2019;d already turned on her heel so fast that her copper-colored locks whirled like tassels on a lamp shade. Her hips swung ever so slightly beneath the skirt of her dress, the hem of which skimmed her bicycle-strong calves as she returned to the back door of Scents &amp; Nonsense to look after things. Tally followed her and settled down on the patio flagstones as my friend went inside. I saw Nabokov, the Russian blue shorthair who made it his business to guard the store day and night, watching the big dog through the window with undisguised feline disdain.</p><p>Basket in hand, I hurried down the winding stone pathway to my living quarters. &#x201c;God, I hope she doesn&#x2019;t get it into her head to set me up with someone,&#x201d; I muttered around a bite of still-warm snickerdoodle.</p><p>Dash, trotting by my left heel, glanced up at me with skeptical brown eyes. He&#x2019;d been one of Astrid&#x2019;s foster dogs about six months earlier. She&#x2019;d told me he was probably purebred, but there was no way of knowing, as he&#x2019;d been found at a highway rest stop and brought, a bit dehydrated but otherwise fine, to the vet&#x2019;s office where she worked. Of course, Astrid agreed to take care of him until a home could be found&#x2014;which was about ten seconds after she brought him into Scents &amp; Nonsense. I&#x2019;d fallen hard for him, and he&#x2019;d been my near constant companion ever since.</p><p>&#x201c;Okay. It&#x2019;s possible, just possible, that it would be nice to finally go on an actual date,&#x201d; I said to him now. Leery of my bad judgment in the past, I&#x2019;d sworn off the opposite sex since my marriage ended. But now that Scents &amp; Nonsense wasn&#x2019;t demanding all my energy and time, I had to admit that a sense of loneliness had begun to seep into my evenings.</p><p>&#x201c;But you know what they say about the men in Poppyville, Dash. The odds here are good, but the goods are pretty odd.&#x201d;</p><p>A hawk screeched from the heights of a pine in the open meadow behind my house. Ignoring it, Dash darted away to nose the diminutive gazebo and ferns beneath the ancient gnarled trunk of the apple tree. He made a small noise in the back of his throat and sat back on his haunches beside the little door I&#x2019;d made from a weathered cedar shake and set into a notch in the bark. Absently, I called him back, distracted by how sun-warmed mint combined so nicely with the musk of incense cedar, a bright but earthy fragrance that followed us to my front door.</p><p>Granted, my home had started as a glorified shed, but it worked for a Pembroke Welsh corgi and a woman who sometimes had to shop in the boy&#x2019;s section to find jeans that fit. The &#x201c;tiny house&#x201d; movement was about living simply in small spaces. I hadn&#x2019;t known anything about it until my half brother, Colby, mentioned it in one of his phone calls from wherever he&#x2019;d stopped his Westfalia van for the week. The idea had immediately appealed to my inner child, who had always wanted a playhouse of her very own, while my environmental side appreciated the smaller, greener footprint. I&#x2019;d hired a contractor from a nearby town who specialized in tiny-house renovations. He&#x2019;d made a ramshackle three-hundred-twenty-square-foot shed into a super-efficient living space.</p><p>There were loads of built-in niches, an alcove in the main living area for a television and stereo, extra foldout seating, a drop-down dining table, and even a desk that tucked away into the wall until needed. A circular staircase led to the sleeping loft above, which boasted a queen bed surrounded by cupboards for linens and clothing and a skylight set into the angled roof. The staircase partially separated the living area from the galley kitchen, and the practical placement of shelves under the spiraling steps made it not only visually stunning, but a terrific place to house my considerable library of horticulture and aromatherapy books.</p><p>Most of the year, the back porch, which ran the seventeen-foot width of the house, was my favorite place to hang out when not in the garden or Scents &amp; Nonsense. It looked out on an expanse of meadow running up to the craggy foothills of Kestrel Peak. Our resident mule deer herd often congregated there near sunset.</p><p>After a quick sluice in the shower, I slipped into a blue cotton sundress that matched my eyes, ran fingers through my dark shoulder-length curls in a feeble attempt to tame them, skipped the makeup, and slid my feet into soft leather sandals. Dash at my heel, I hurried down the path to the shop. I inhaled bee balm, a hint of basil, lemon verbena, and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. what was <i>that</i>?</p><p>My steps paused, and I felt my forehead wrinkle. I knew every flower, every leaf in this garden, and every scent they gave off. I again thought of my gamma, who had taught me about plants and aromatherapy&#x2014;though she never would have used that word. She would have known immediately what created this intoxicating fragrance.</p><p><i>Check her garden journal.</i> Though without more information it would be difficult to search the tattered, dog-eared volume in which she&#x2019;d recorded her botanical observations, sketches, flower recipes, and lore.</p><p>A flutter in my peripheral vision made me turn my head, but where I&#x2019;d expected to see a bird winging into one of the many feeders, there was nothing. At the same time, a sudden breeze grabbed away the mysterious fragrance and tickled the wind chimes.</p><p>Glancing down, I noticed the engraved river rock by the fairy path I&#x2019;d been forming earlier appeared to have shifted.</p><p>For a second, I thought it read BEWARE.</p><p>My head whipped up as I wildly searched the garden. When I looked down again, the word BELIEVE cheerfully beckoned again.</p><p><i>Just a trick of the light, Ellie.</i></p><p>Still, I stared at the smooth stone for what felt like a long time. Then I shook my head and continued to the patio. After giving Tally a quick pat on the head, I wended my way between two rocking chairs and opened the sliding door to Scents &amp; Nonsense.</p><p>Nabby slipped outside, rubbing his gray velvety self against my bare leg before he touched noses with Dash, threw Tally a warning look, and padded out to bask in the sunshine. A brilliant blue butterfly settled near the cat and opened its iridescent wings to the warming day. As I turned away, two more floated in to join the first. As the cat moved toward his preferred perch on the retaining wall, the butterflies wafted behind him like balloons on a string.

Real life happens, and our circumstances take us on an emotional rollercoaster ride. So the Bible&#x2019;s call to &#x201c;be joyful always&#x201d; sounds almost crazy&#x2014;and out of reach. But it doesn&#x2019;t have to be.</p><p>Joy is meant to be ours, a joy that is defiant in the face of this broken world. This joy is not simply happiness on steroids; it&#x2019;s the unyielding belief that sorrow and loss do not have the final say. It&#x2019;s the stubborn determination to be present to whatever may come and to interpret both goodness and grief by the light of heaven.</p><p>In <em>Defiant Joy</em>, Stasi Eldredge invites us with courage, candor, and tender vulnerability to a place beyond sadness or happiness. She shows us how to maintain a posture of holy defiance that neither denies nor diminishes our pain but dares to live with expectant, unwavering hope.</p></p><p><p>Stasi Eldredge is a <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author, and her books have sold nearly 3 million copies and changed women's lives all over the world.

Moving through all five boroughs, neighborhood by neighborhood, it offers the most complete overview of New York's significant places, past and present. The Fifth Edition continues to include places of historical importance--including extensive coverage of the World Trade Center site--while also taking full account of the construction boom of the past 10 years, a boom that has given rise to an unprecedented number of new buildings by such architects as Frank Gehry, Norman Foster, and Renzo Piano. All of the buildings included in the Fourth Edition have been revisited and re-photographed and much of the commentary has been re-written, and coverage of the outer boroughs--particularly Brooklyn--has been expanded. <br> Famed skyscrapers and historic landmarks are detailed, but so, too, are firehouses, parks, churches, parking garages, monuments, and bridges. Boasting more than 3000 new photographs, 100 enhanced maps, and thousands of short and spirited entries, the guide is arranged geographically by borough, with each borough divided into sectors and then into neighborhood. Extensive commentaries describe the character of the divisions.<br> Knowledgeable, playful, and beautifully illustrated, here is the ultimate guided tour of New York's architectural treasures. <br> <br> Acclaim for earlier editions of the <em>AIA Guide to New York City</em>:<br> <br> "An extraordinarily learned, personable exegesis of our metropolis. No other American or, for that matter, world city can boast so definitive a one-volume guide to its built environment." <br> -- Philip Lopate, <em>New York Times</em><br> <br> "Blithe in spirit and unerring in vision."<br> -- <em>New York Magazine</em><br> <br> "A definitive record of New York's architectural heritage... witty and helpful pocketful which serves as arbiter of architects, Baedeker for boulevardiers, catalog for the curious, primer for preservationists, and sourcebook to students. For all who seek to know of New York, it is here. No home should be without a copy." <br> -- Municipal Art Society<br> <br> "There are two reasons the guide has entered the pantheon of New York books. One is its encyclopedic nature, and the other is its inimitable style--'smart, vivid, funny and opinionated' as the architectural historian Christopher Gray once summed it up in pithy W &amp; W fashion."<br> -- Constance Rosenblum, <em>New York Times</em><br><br>"A book for architectural gourmands and gastronomic gourmets." <br> -- <em>The Village Voice </em><br></p><p><br><strong>Norval White</strong> is Professor Emeritus, School of Architecture, City College of New York.

Part of the reason for their excitement may have been that the building was once the home of Jane Jacobs, the writer and activist. More likely, though, is that the picture-taking session marked the official end of the lengthy research phase for the fifth edition of the AIA Guide to New York City, the wryly written block-by-block directory of landmarks that's become an essential reference for architects, planners, and developers, as well as residents."--C.J. Hughes, <em>Architectural Record</em><p></p><br>"The new guide, readers will be pleased to know, is a vast improvement over its predecessor, beginning with a redesigned retro-'70s cover that replaces the widely loathed faux-metal version of the fourth edition. The new book is also trimmer than its predecessor, though its content is greatly expanded, thanks to a shift to a two-column page layout.

All 125 entries include a transcript of the letter; a short introduction; and, in 100 cases, a captivating facsimile of the letter itself. The artfulness of Shaun Usher's eclectic arrangement creates a reading experience rich in discovery.

A letter from Elvis Presley to President Nixon is written in-flight on American Airlines stationary, in which Presley expresses his patriotism and requests to be made a Federal Agent, "just so long as it is kept very private." Each of the letters is accompanied with a contextual note from Usher that only serves to add to the fascination and potential rabbit hole of additional research readers might find themselves falling into.<br><br>From art to music, politics, history, civil rights and drawing on just about every human emotion, it's easy to get lost in the 342-page tome. Each letter tells its own stories and it is easy to find oneself interested in new subjects. Perhaps the book's greatest virtue (and that of correspondence itself) is its ability to inject individual humanity into historical events and time periods. One highlight is a letter from a free slave to his former master, kindly rejecting an offer of a job while inquiring about the family and describing his new life. These true stories-whether they're between household names or persons unknown-reflect the great importance of interpersonal communication and the beauty of long-form written conversation." <br>- Cool Hunting<br><br>"While a good portion of history happened out in the open, allowing it to be preserved in the history books for everyone to read for generations, still more happened in the private correspondence of people who mattered.

With the same dazzling storytelling that distinguished his first memoir, Homer Hickam takes us deeper into the soul of his West Virginia hometown at a moment when its unique way of life is buffeted by forces of time and change. <br><br>It is fall 1959. Homer &#x201c;Sonny&#x201d; Hickam and his fellow Rocket Boys are in their senior year at Big Creek High, and the town of Coalwood finds itself at a painful crossroads. <br><br>The strains can be felt within the Hickam home, where Homer Sr. struggles to save the mine, and his wife, Elsie, is feeling increasingly isolated from both her family and the townspeople. Sonny, despite a blossoming relationship with a local girl, finds his own mood darkened by an unexplainable sadness. <br><br>Then, with the holidays approaching, trouble at the mine and the arrival of a beautiful young outsider bring unexpected changes in both the Hickam family and the town of Coalwood ... as this luminous memoir moves toward its poignant conclusion.</p><p>In this follow-up to his bestselling autobiography <i>Rocket Boys</i>, Homer Hickam chronicles the eventful autumn of 1959 in his hometown, the West Virginia mining town of Coalwood. Sixteen-year-old Homer and his pals in the Big Creek Missile Agency are high school seniors, still building homemade rockets and hoping that science will provide them with a ticket into the wider world of college and white-collar jobs. Such dreams make them suspect in a conservative small town where "getting above yourself" is the ultimate sin and where Homer's father, superintendent of the Coalwood mines, is stingy with praise and dubious about his son's ambitions. Homer's mother remains supportive, but bluntly reminds him, "You can't expect everything to go your way. Sometimes life just has another plan." Indeed, Hickam's unvarnished portrait of Coalwood covers class warfare (union miners battling with his authoritarian father), provincial narrow-mindedness (the local ladies scorn a young woman living outside wedlock with a man who abuses her), and endless gossiping along the picket "fence line." These sharp details make the unabashed sentiment of the book's closing chapters feel earned rather than easy. Hickam can spin a gripping yarn and keep multiple underlying themes and metaphors going at the same time. His tender but gritty memoir will touch readers' hearts and minds. <i>--Wendy Smith</i>Homer H. Hickam, Jr., was born and raised in Coalwood, West Virginia.

Mark has illustrated many wonderful children's books, including <em>I Am the Cat </em>by Alice Schertle and <em>Harvy Potter's Balloon Farm </em>by Jerdine Nolen.</p>Ages 5-8. Gaggles of round-faced children, some in Pilgrim outfits and others in deerskins, fill this rhymed counting tale, along with an inquisitive turkey and a fair number of bunnies. It must be said that the rhymes are clunky, but the cheer is fairly irrepressible as 1 Pilgrim boy naps in a tree, while 2 Wampanoag kids giggle as they gather nuts. And so it goes, ending with the 12 harvest tables laden with food for both Pilgrims and Indians. In each spread, a careful look reveals the turkey peering from behind a tree, rock, or outcropping; even in the final feast, he's sticking his neck out from behind a cabin. The bunnies are everywhere: hiding behind tree trunks when the Wampanoag kids go out with bows and arrows, watching (alongside the turkey) as 10 Wampanoag youngsters make baskets, gamboling among the cornstalks while 9 young Pilgrims pick corn. <i>GraceAnne DeCandido</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Delving into the soul of the Salatin family's nationally acclaimed Polyface Farm, author Joel Salatin offers <em>Family Friendly Farming</em> as the key to dealing with resource issues, food policy, and social fabric.</p> <p>With humor and personal stories, he opens his family and farm convictions for all to see, share, and enjoy. Written from his unabashed "Christian libertarian environmentalist capitalist" perspective, his ideas are guaranteed to encourage and challenge virtually every "ism" in the culture. It will captivate anyone passionate about healing the land, healing families, and healing the food supply.</p> <p>For several decades young people have been leaving the family farm. The ones left behind are now responsible for society's greatest resources: clean land and clean food. Anyone dedicated to preserving these resources will find in these pages a nongovernmental, self-empowerment approach to environmentalism and food safety.</p> <p>The heart of this book is aimed toward parents tired of their Dilbert cubicle at the end of the expressway who want to reconnect with their children through a pastoral lifestyle. It's written for anyone who yearns to grow old working with and being adored by value-sharing grandchildren and honored by passionate, productive adult children. <em>Family Friendly Farming</em> can make any family business more viable and any family more functional.</p> <p>The ten-chapter section on how to get the kids to love the farm is an invaluable addition to any collection of child-rearing manuals. Salatin moves from the family team-building section into a practical discussion on how to increase income per acre and create new, white-collar salaries without buying more land, equipment, or buildings. He deals with the unique and thorny issues surrounding any family business by using his own multi-generational family farm experience as his base for insight and wisdom.</p></p><p><p>Joel Salatin and his family own and operate Polyface Farm in Virginia&#x2019;s Shenandoah Valley.

Author and expert coach, Richard Strozzi-Heckler, PhD, explains that in order to achieve truly sustainable changes in individuals, teams, and organizations, it is necessary to implement body-oriented somatic practices in order to dissolve habits, behaviors, and interpretations of the world that are no longer relevant. He explains that these ways of being are integrated in the body--at the level of the musculature, organs, and nervous system. By implementing a somatic approach, these patterns can be shifted in order for transformation to occur.<br> &nbsp;<br> Opening with a discussion of the roots of Somatic Coaching, the book describes the emotional and physical cost of being distanced from our bodies. Originating from the rationalistic idea that the mind and body are separate, this sense of disconnection spurred the emergence of the field of somatics that views the body as not just a physiological entity, but as the center of our lived experience in the world. Out of this philosophy, Somatic Coaching was developed as a way to cultivate the self through the body.<br> &nbsp;<br> Methods in this book include: <br> � Somatic awareness--becoming aware of sensations <br> � Somatic opening--includes bodywork to release held patterns in the body <br> � Somatic practices--meditation, movement, and being present in everyday life<br> &nbsp;<br> The social context in which one is raised, the supportive, healing force of the outdoors and nature as well as acknowledgment of the spirit are also woven into the practice. Through these practices, a rhythm of unfolding occurs in what Strozzi-Heckler describes as an Arc of Transformation--moving in stages from conditioned tendencies to a new satisfying and fulfilling way of being that is fully embodied.<br> &nbsp;<br> Contents: Introduction; Chapter One: A Short Distance but a Big Cost; Chapter Two: Coaching; Chapter Three: Somatics and Somatic Coaching; Chapter Four: The Methodology; Chapter Five: The Rhythm of Action; Chapter Six: The Somatic Arc of Transformation</p></p><p>Named one of the top fifty executive coaches worldwide in the landmark resource <i>The Art and Practice of Leadership Coaching</i>, RICHARD STROZZI-HECKLER, PhD, an internationally known speaker, coach, and consultant on leadership and mastery, is the president of the Strozzi Institute, which offers consulting and coaching services to individuals and companies on five continents.

He illuminates the smallest, almost invisible ways in which the culture shapes people to live at a distance from the body, even when consciously embracing a unitary philosophy. He puts forward a model of somatic coaching with easy-to-implement strategies that seamlessly weave practices of sensitive attention, conversation, breathing, touch, movement, and gestures. This book is particularly unique in its breaking out of a model of transformation that tends to be too narrowly focused on individuals and small groups, rather than the very large populations which have the major role in shaping the world.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;Don Hanlon Johnson, PhD, founder of the Somatic Psychotherapy graduate degree program at California Institute of Integral Studies and author of <i>Everyday Hopes, Utopian Dreams: Reflections on American Ideals</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Rarely do we meet genuine embodied human wisdom as we do in this book.

It&#39;s hidden in the planning sessions of colleagues, in the professional development opportunities at schools and conferences, and in the hallways as teachers and administrators talk with each other about their students. It&#39;s been happening in pockets for so long, that now those groups of teachers and leaders are starting to bring in new teachers and new leaders to build a true culture of learning that looks and feels different. It&#39;s taking shape as a revolution of sorts (but not some type of education reform) that is beginning to make its way into every school and every classroom. The textbooks are no longer &#34;good enough&#34;, and the multiple-choice tests are no longer &#34;good enough&#34;, and the lectures are no longer &#34;good enough&#34; for our kids. We&#39;ve seen what can happen when students are presented with a problem to solve, a challenge to overcome. We&#39;ve seen what can happen when students have learning experiences that are both relevant and meaningful to them as an individual and citizen. We&#39;ve seen what can happen when students own their learning, have a choice in the process and performance task, and get to choose how they can demonstrate understanding. Project-based learning (PBL) is no longer relegated to gifted classrooms, honors classes, and exploratory specials. PBL is an active piece of the K-12 learning experience, found in every subject, in every grade level, and in every part of curricula and scope and sequences. PBL is taking over traditional finals and mid-terms as the performance task. It is showing up as HOW you teach the unit, instead of only an ending project to the unit. PBL is growing because it engages and empowers students to learn experientially and share that learning in new and unique ways that go well beyond the classroom. Yet, many teachers are asking: How do we plan and implement PBL? How do we &#34;fit it in&#34; our current curriculum? How do we assess it using our current grading guidelines? How do we manage this type of learning? These are all real concerns and questions that cannot be dismissed. PBL takes time to plan, implement, manage, and assess. Then it takes time to tweak, improve, and highlight. In The PBL Playbook, we dive into specific answers to all those questions, and what PBL looks like in each grade level and subject area! The PBL Playbook is right for you if: You are a teacher ready to move towards an authentic learning experience for your students. You are a superintendent, district administrator, or principal who is leading a school through project-based learning. You are a coach, staff developer, or teacher leader that wants to help guide colleagues into PBL with a gameplan that works.</p><p>A.J.

Filled your journal with more thoughts about guys than God? Found yourself jealous because that other girl gets all the dates? Maybe it&#x2019;s time to get lost&#x2014;in God.<br>&nbsp;<br><b>Discover how to get so lost in God that a guy has to seek <i>Him </i>to find <i>you.</i></b><br><i>&nbsp;</i><br>Dannah Gresh traces God&#x2019;s language of love through Scripture to help you pursue your heart&#x2019;s deepest desires and seek love the way God designed it to be.

And the Great Mix-Up.<br><br>This is a book about God...<br>...and guys...<br>...and how we get them mixed up.<br><br>Oh, do we ever.<br><br>It shows up in the little things: picking the short skirt, racing to update a relationship status on Facebook, filling a journal with guy-talk instead of God-talk, texting under the pillow at night, jumping from guy to guy, taking the &#x201c;walk of shame&#x201d;...again, or bailing on friends when a guy calls. As you think about similar choices in your own life and what they suggest about the priorities of your heart, you may have an intuition that I&#x2019;m right. Your spirit gets it, if your mind does not.<br><br>I&#x2019;m certain that a part of you desperately wants to get lost in God&#x2019;s love. At least some small piece of us always seems to be aware that we are wired to seek God&#x2019;s heart and to let Him touch our own. But it&#x2019;s so difficult. After all, the love of a guy is so stinkin&#x2019; tangible. You can see a guy. Smell a guy. Touch a guy. Hug a guy. Text a guy. Get gifts from a guy. And they are everywhere! There are more than 139 million men in the United States alone. No wonder we get distracted from seeking God&#x2019;s love! I certainly have been prone to reach for the tangible love of a guy rather than the ultimate love of God. As I look back on one particular scene from my sophomore year in college, I see it as a classic example of my own mixed-up thinking. <br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll meet you in the yearbook office in one hour,&#x201d; I confirmed to Russ before I hung up the phone. Russ was my yearbook editor at Cedarville University, and after two years of hard work, I was in line for his position the following year. On top of being a great r�sum� builder, the job came with a hefty scholarship. If my boss needed me, I&#x2019;d<br>be there!<br><br>Since I wouldn&#x2019;t have time to hit the cafeteria, I turned on my electric kettle to boil water for some Kraft Macaroni &amp; Cheese. It wasn&#x2019;t fancy, but it was fast. I was pouring neon-orange powder over buttered macaroni noodles when my phone rang again. Before I could get out a hello I heard, &#x201c;Dannah Barker, say you&#x2019;ll marry me. But if you can&#x2019;t, then at least break it to me gently by saying you&#x2019;ll go to Wittenberg with me to study.&#x201d;<br><br>Bob Gresh!<br><br>This guy, whom I&#x2019;d been dating for a while, always kept me laughing.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes!&#x201d; I giggled. &#x201c;When?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be right over,&#x201d; he said. It shouldn&#x2019;t have surprised me. Bob was the definition of spontaneity.<br><br>&#x201c;Umm,&#x201d; I hesitated, thinking about the commitment I&#x2019;d just made to go help Russ. And I really did want that job next year. Should I risk it?<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll run through Lee&#x2019;s on the way for some chicken,&#x201d; he promised.<br><br>&#x201c;Well...okay,&#x201d; I said, dumping my noodles into the trash can. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go!&#x201d;<br><br>For a brief moment, I considered calling Russ to cancel, but I wasn&#x2019;t sure what to tell him. The truth: This great guy just proposed marriage or a date at the Wittenberg library, and I chose the latter when I&#x2019;m really shamelessly going for the first option! Or the other truth: I&#x2019;m a complete dolt, risking what I&#x2019;ve worked two years to achieve in that<br>yearbook office all because I&#x2019;m incapable of saying anything but &#x201c;yes&#x201d; or &#x201c;oh, yes!&#x201d; to this guy because I crave him night and day. Either way I&#x2019;d sound like a complete loser.<br><br>So I didn&#x2019;t call Russ. I needed to think of a good excuse first. (Read: I was planning to tell a really good lie.)<br><br>I gathered my books, met Bob in front of my dorm, and jumped into his white sports car, casting aside my integrity.<br><br>God in all His sovereignty made sure I&#x2019;d run into Russ&#x2019;s best friend at the Wittenberg library. Russ was forgiving, but I&#x2019;d have given almost anything (except my boyfriend, of course) to have not seen the disappointment register in his eyes when the truth unfolded.<br><br>There was no denying the truth.<br><br>I was guy-crazy with no ambition to be God-crazy.<br><br>That impulsive decision&#x2014;along with so many others&#x2014;was driven by a deep-rooted reality: I had confused my longing for God&#x2019;s love with my longing for a guy&#x2019;s love. All because of the Craving.<br><br>The Violent Craving.<br><br>You have it. Your friends have it. Your mom had it. Your grandma had it. Your greatgrandma had it. It&#x2019;s been around awhile.<br><br>Countless generations of woman have experienced it.<br><br>The Craving is a part of the Curse, which means it dates all the way back to Eve. After she and Adam sinned, God showed up to explain that things would never be the same. To Eve, He talked about the Craving. Genesis 3:16b reads, <i>Your desire shall be for your husband, and he shall rule over you.<br><br></i>The word &#x201c;desire&#x201d; is critical here. Two respected theologians once said that the Hebrew language used in this verse evokes a &#x201c;desire bordering upon disease.&#x201d; They also said that the desire might best be called a &#x201c;violent craving.&#x201d; In the original language of the Bible, God used some pretty expressive wording to describe what women would experience in relation to men after the Fall. Simply put, we hunger for them. The Craving makes us all insatiably hungry for the attention of a guy, but each of us experiences this desire in a slightly different way.<br><br>I asked college-aged women who follow my blog to share how the Violent Craving has shown up in their lives. Here&#x2019;s a sampling of their responses:<br><br>I have felt the Violent Craving expressed as jealousy toward my peers that have boyfriends. How foolish I felt, to feel jealous instead of happy, when a friend started dating a guy I DIDN&#x2019;T EVEN WANT TO DATE.<br><br>Elementary school to high school, I didn&#x2019;t get the attention I wanted. I was the chunky monkey that everyone went to for a good laugh. It wasn&#x2019;t until I got to be around 16 I got the attention from guys, and it got the best of me and took one of the most valuable things from me&#x2014;my virginity. I lost it to a friend who liked my sister and respected her, but thought I would be the easier choice. And he was right.<br><br>My main regret would be that I haven&#x2019;t spent my time enjoying my singleness.<br><br>There used to be a boy that I cared for very much. He was godly Christian, extremely polite, and we communicated through e-mail almost daily. My deep longing to be desired and pursued blinded my eyes from the warning signs that he wasn&#x2019;t everything he claimed to be. A year or two after I met him, he ended up having sex with my younger sister on the couch in our living room.<br><br>I went to a secular university and was involved in a campus ministry. One of the most popular sayings among the girls was &#x201c;ring by spring.&#x201d; To say there was a Violent Craving toward the idea of having a husband is an understatement.... I was the only single girl in the apartment. I allowed myself to be ruled by a Violent Craving for a husband.<br><br>My Craving started at the age of twelve when my dad passed away. I longed for a man to notice me. I wanted that attention. I dressed to attract men and wanted a man&#x2019;s approval.<br><br>They shared countless such stories, each expressing a sense of &#x201c;eureka&#x201d; at finally having a diagnosis for their symptoms! Of all the voices who offered examples of how they express, deny, loathe, live in, and ache from the Craving, it was a sweet seventeenyear-old girl whose experience mostly clearly described the effects of the Genesis 3:16 curse. She wrote,<br><br>I&#x2019;m seventeen, raised by a very liberal mother and an extremely conservative father. That marriage didn&#x2019;t work out. It ended when I was seven. Since then, I&#x2019;ve always been very angry about marriage and cynical of love, due to its causing much pain, loneliness, and anxiety in my life. I swore I&#x2019;d never marry. But even with all that confusion and anger, I still desperately wanted to be noticed and passionately loved by a man. I wanted someone to see and know me. The first guy I had any real relationship with, I clung to for four years, desperate for his attention and love. During those four years, I made many mistakes. I gave him everything I could physically and emotionally just to keep him around (except the actual act of sex). He was a need. A necessity. But why? I hated marriage yet wanted a man.<br><br>She &#x201c;hated marriage yet wanted a man.&#x201d; I believe that&#x2019;s the modern-day aftermath of the Fall. The consequence of original sin&#x2014;and all the ways women have rebelled since then against God&#x2019;s design&#x2014;results in both a hatred of God-designed marriage and an insatiable longing for the presence of a guy. (The Craving may not cause you to actually hate marriage, but you may hate God&#x2019;s specific design and purpose for it. A lot of us struggle with that!) I believe that every daughter of Eve is burdened by both a Craving for a husband and a rebellion against God&#x2019;s design for marriage.

I let my eyes roam over the sixteen faces I see in the bleachers. Everyone looks excited to begin working again. It&#x2019;s been only four months since the end of the first year&#x2019;s work, but these students have changed. The effect is subtle, hard to put a finger on. Suffice it to say that these students seem like clearer versions of the people they were before. They laugh a little louder, and more readily. They smile a lot. And they listen well. They really listen.<br><br>Each time I look into a student&#x2019;s eyes, I see something new&#x2014;�or perhaps that&#x2019;s not right. Perhaps it&#x2019;s really something old, an original part of him or her that was there all along, but pushed to the back and hidden. Now that part has stepped to the fore. It was always ready. All it needed was permission to come forth and shine.<br><br>But there&#x2019;s one face I don&#x2019;t recognize.<br><br>Bill takes a seat at his table, which, like the student bleachers, looks out on the studio&#x2019;s playing space: two beds, some chairs, a table, and shelves full of odds and ends that the students can use in rehearsal. Bill opens his roll book and thumbs to a page. &#x201c;Ray?&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;Where are you?&#x201d;<br><br>The man with the face I don&#x2019;t recognize holds up a hand, and all eyes turn that way. He appears to be about forty. He has a compact build, thinning hair, and a plain, handsome face with eyes the color of winter skies that shift from blue to gray. There&#x2019;s something about his manner that suggests a man of the earth, someone who works long hours with his hands. A farmer or a rancher. Maybe a cabinetmaker or carpenter.<br><br>Bill turns to the rest of the class. &#x201c;Everyone, this is Ray. He did the first year&#x2019;s work in another class here at the Studio. He&#x2019;ll join us now for the second year&#x2019;s work.&#x201d;<br><br>Everyone waves to Ray and says hi. Ray, who seems shy, waves back.<br><br>&#x201c;So,&#x201d; says Bill. He closes his roll book and looks around the room. &#x201c;Before we begin, I want to tell you a story from my distant, ignoble past.&#x201d;<br><br>The class laughs, and Bill smiles.<br><br>&#x201c;I went to college at Case Western Reserve, which is in Cleveland,&#x201d; Bill says. &#x201c;I had always wanted to study acting, so I enrolled in the program there, but my first year was disastrous. I was very young and, when I acted, I didn&#x2019;t have a truthful bone in my body.<br><br>&#x201c;Fortunately, a woman named Nadine Miles was my acting teacher. She had once played on Broadway with Sandy Meisner in a production of Eugene O&#x2019;Neill&#x2019;s Marco Millions. This woman was merciless with me. She kicked my butt, metaphorically speaking, up and down campus. It took me a while, but eventually I figured out that I didn&#x2019;t know much of anything about acting. That was the beginning of my education.&#x201d;<br><br>One glance around the room and I can tell that Bill has struck a chord with this group. All eyes are on him, the students rapt.<br><br>&#x201c;So this is what I did,&#x201d; Bill says. &#x201c;I went to the main branch of the Cleveland downtown library where they had a small collection of theater books. The titles all looked the same to me. I didn&#x2019;t know which were considered seminal works, which would make an impact on me, which were regarded as must-�reads&#x2014;�I was like a babe in the woods. So I picked up the first book on the shelf and I started to read. When I finished that book, I read the next one, and the next, and the next, until I&#x2019;d read right through the shelf. Doing that turned my work around. I can&#x2019;t say I became a great artist overnight, but I can say I began to appreciate what important art is about.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s funny how life works. Years later, I was studying at the Neighborhood Playhouse. Sandy Meisner assigned us oral reports on famous figures in the theater. Sandy felt then the way I do now: most actors don&#x2019;t have enough knowledge about the great artists who have preceded them. He assigned me to report on Edward Gordon Craig, and I already knew all about him. I had read Craig&#x2019;s books during my spree in the Cleveland library.<br><br>&#x201c;Among other things, Craig was a set designer. He designed a very famous production of Hamlet that Stanislavsky directed featuring giant screens that shifted continuously in the background. It was a brilliant idea, but it wasn&#x2019;t practical. The screens were big and cumbersome. Every time somebody tried to move them, they fell over. After endless attempts to keep them upright, Stanislavsky, in despair, ordered them nailed to the floor of the stage.<br><br>&#x201c;I confess, my report disparaged Craig somewhat. I compared him to another designer of the time, Adolphe Appia, who is credited with breaking away from the two-�dimensional painted set pieces that dominated the late nineteenth century and constructing the first three-�dimensional sets. Appia built environments that worked with light and shadow in ways that were more natural to life. His constructions were always practical; Appia never built a set that fell down. And by crafting a three-�dimensional set, he was, in fact, granting actors the license to behave in three-�dimensional ways. Actors could walk on Appia&#x2019;s sets. Climb on them. Sit on them. Really live.<br><br>&#x201c;In my report I said that, in my opinion, Edward Gordon Craig was a dreamer, while Adolphe Appia was more practical-�minded. But Sandy took issue with this. &#x2018;Aren&#x2019;t dreamers important?&#x2019; he asked. &#x2018;Don&#x2019;t we need people who dream?&#x2019; He had a point, of course. Ultimately, Craig fell short of presenting his vision of Hamlet. But as with all visionaries, his true gift was the ability to change our perceptions of what is possible, to push our horizons further into what we consider the unknown.<br><br>&#x201c;I admitted to Sandy that the relationship between dreamer and pragmatist is often closer than we first imagine it to be. Dreamers contribute something essential to society and especially to art. In fact, I said, dreamers are more important than pragmatists; you can&#x2019;t obtain any far-�reaching goal until you&#x2019;ve conceived of it in the first place. Sandy seemed impressed by that. In fact, I think that was the moment that sparked our long collaboration. Years later, he would say to me, &#x2018;Do you remember the talk we had about Craig and Appia?&#x2019; Of course I did! And&#x2014;�just so I&#x2019;m being clear on this point&#x2014;�the whole thing started from reading those books!&#x201d;<br><br>The class laughs. Bill grins, but then his face grows sober again. &#x201c;Why do I mention this story? Because I have always hated dilettantes. I simply don&#x2019;t understand people who don&#x2019;t have passions, who aren&#x2019;t insatiably curious, and who don&#x2019;t want to know absolutely everything about their chosen profession. And of course this applies to you, right now. Because whether you know it or not, you find yourself at a crossroads.&#x201d;<br><br>Now the class grows sober as well.<br><br>&#x201c;Not everyone is a character actor,&#x201d; Bill says. &#x201c;The talent some actors possess lies in straight acting. They may be marvelous at it. Certainly, for many it&#x2019;s sufficient to get them work and allow them to have a career. Even if you&#x2019;re not a character actor, there&#x2019;s a great deal to get from this second year&#x2019;s work. Though I warn you all: The second-�year work will push you to the very limits of your talent. Will that be a problem for anyone here?&#x201d;<br><br>None of the students move. None so much as flinch. Bill appears satisfied.<br><br>&#x201c;Good,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;Then let&#x2019;s review what you learned last year.&#x201d;<br><br>Amber answers. &#x201c;The reality of doing.&#x201d;<br><br>Bill nods. &#x201c;Practice the reality of doing when you work and you almost can&#x2019;t go wrong. What else?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Acting is really an improvisation.&#x201d; This is Adam speaking. &#x201c;You learn your lines mechanically, without interpretation. You pin down certain meanings, then you set about rehearsing. Your scene won&#x2019;t happen the same way twice if you&#x2019;re working from moment to moment.&#x201d;<br><br>Bill smiles. &#x201c;That was a mouthful, but it&#x2019;s all correct. Acting is most exciting to watch when it&#x2019;s a ping-�pong game of impulses between you and your partner. If you lose the moment-�to-�moment work, it&#x2019;s like you&#x2019;ve missed a swing with your paddle. The ping-�pong ball flies off the table and the game comes to a screeching halt. Let me ask you: Where should your attention always be placed when you act?&#x201d;<br><br>Melissa says, &#x201c;On your partner. Or on your activity.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Very good,&#x201d; Bill says. &#x201c;God forbid that you keep your attention on yourself. There&#x2019;s nothing more uninteresting to watch. Trevor? Can you add something?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I think so.&#x201d; Trevor holds up one of his famous notebooks. Last year, he was always taking notes. He went through five whole notebooks before Christmas. &#x201c;I wrote this down, like, a hundred times last year: Don&#x2019;t do anything unless someone or something else makes you do it.&#x201d;<br><br>Bill nods. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m glad you wrote that down so often. It&#x2019;s one of the most important concepts in acting, and yes, it&#x2019;ll certainly come up this year as well. Yes, Dom? What is it?&#x201d;<br><br>Dom tilts his head thoughtfully. &#x201c;Everything has to be personal,&#x201d; he says.<br><br>Bill nods. &#x201c;Could you more specific?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You can only work from things that really and truly motivate you. Like with daydreams, for instance. A fantasy that sparks behavior in me might not bring Melissa or Reg to life. Their fantasies probably won&#x2019;t inspire me. Crafting has to be personal. It has to be unique to you, based on the things that activate you and you alone.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Very good,&#x201d; Bill says. &#x201c;By drawing your work from the well of yourself, you create a performance which is not only truthful, but inimitable. We&#x2019;ve all seen actors with no inner life. They&#x2019;re awful to watch, cardboard cutouts of human beings. You and you alone know the things that make you tick. Last year, you spent a lot of time using Independent Activities and Emotional Preparations to create an emotional life.&#x201d;<br><br>Trevor has started leafing through another notebook. He raises his hand again. &#x201c;Bill? I also wrote this down a lot: Be specific. Never be general.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Bill says. &#x201c;But what does that mean?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Things that are specific have meaning,&#x201d; says Donna. &#x201c;Whereas general things do not.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s true,&#x201d; Bill said. &#x201c;Most people walk through their lives without closely examining anything. They don&#x2019;t dig down to the heart of things, they stay on the barren crust. An actor can&#x2019;t afford to do that. In truth, nothing general happens in nature, so nothing general should happen in your acting.&#x201d;<br><br>Each student in class brings up a point that struck him or her from last year&#x2019;s work. Cheryl says she often thinks about coming to the door in the early phases of the exercise. She talks about entering the room and letting yourself stand there, open and ready to be affected by your partner.<br><br>&#x201c;Vulnerability,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s everything when you&#x2019;re acting.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Bill says. &#x201c;No one wants to watch an actor who&#x2019;s wearing a Kevlar vest over his emotions. The actor&#x2019;s job is not to fancy himself superhuman. We must open ourselves to every moment and live it out fully in a way that audiences only dream about doing. Invulnerability has as much place in acting as a sledgehammer has in the art of glassblowing. When you come to act, you must tear down your walls. Allow yourself to be free.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Like a feather in the breeze,&#x201d; Reg says. &#x201c;That was how you described it last year. Or a cork bobbing on ocean waves. Allow yourself to go in any direction the current takes you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Bill says. &#x201c;Exactly.&#x201d;</p><h2>Low Tide (The Forgotten Coast Florida Suspense Series)</h2><p><strong><em>In Apalachicola, Florida, sinister things are afoot, as sinister things tend to be.</em></strong>Lt. Maggie Redmond is called to a crime scene on St. George Island, where she is met with the body of Gregory Boudreaux. The medical examiner calls it a suicide, but no one knows that Maggie has a horrible connection to the dead man.When Gregory&#x2019;s uncle, Bennett Boudreaux, the richest and scariest man in town, takes a sudden interest in Maggie, people start to wonder, Maggie included. Maggie knows he may suspect her of killing his nephew, but she finds herself slowly drawn to the man. As Maggie fights to help a young girl escape the clutches of a volatile drug dealer who&#x2019;d love to see Maggie dead, she also struggles to hide her dark link to a dead man, and her burgeoning relationship with her boss, Sheriff Wyatt Hamilton. <strong>Unfortunately, secrets have a way of revealing themselves at low tide.</strong></p><p>I write Southern books. I was born and raised in Florida and now live in Tennessee. I couldn&#39;t take the South out of my writing if I wanted to, but I wouldn&#39;t dream of such a thing. Between its quirky, small towns dripping in atmosphere, and its collection of fascinating, funny and remarkable people, I could never get tired of making the South itself the main character in all of my books. I might write a quiet little love story set on a dirt road in Alabama (See You). Or a semi-noir, darkly funny and atmospheric suspense series set in Apalachicola, FL (The Forgotten Coast Florida Suspense series). Or a wryly funny, but ultimately sweet book about two outsiders in 1970s Alabama who find their places in the world when they find each other (the upcoming The Cricket Jar). These books have a lot in common, despite how different they might seem. They are all character-driven novels about people who are damaged but strong, deeply funny, and all the more beautiful because of their flaws. I love these people, from 90-year old Creole nanny Miss Evangeline, to the droll and honorable Jack Canfield, to strong but damaged cop Maggie Redmond, and even the hilariously inappropriate and dangerously charming bad guy, Bennett Boudreaux. I hope that you&#39;ll meet them all, and love them all as I do.</p><h2>AMAZING SPIDER-MAN: EDGE OF SPIDER-VERSE</h2><p>Peer over the edge of the Spider-Verse, at five different realities...and five daringly different spiders!

This story of survival is told with suspense by Velma Wallis, whose subject matter challenges the taboos of her past. Yet, her themes are modern--empowerment of women, the graying of America, growing interest in Native American ways.</p><p>Velma Wallis and her mother were chopping wood at the mouth of the Porcupine River, where it flows into the Yukon, when Wallis first heard the legend of the Two Old Women - an elderly pair's "journey into hardship." Passed from mothers to daughters for many generations, the ancient story of abandonment is tragic and shocking but comes with a surprise that will lighten your heart. In 1993, Velma Wallis's retelling of the legen in book form challenged her people's oral traditions and revealed old taboos, yet revealed universal themes. Ten years after the first edition, Two Old Women has been translated into seventeen languages, sellingmore than one million copies. Today, the legend is still being passed between mother and daughter, and from sister to sister, with its hopeful lesson for us all.<br>Velma Wallis is Alaska's contemporary bestselling author. One of thirteen children, she was born in Fort Yukon, a small Gwich'in Athbascan community at the confluence of the Porcupine and Yukon rivers in Alaska.

Kennedy, thirty-fifth president of the United States, and Allen Dulles, our nation&#x2019;s longest-serving CIA director, often clashed over intelligence issues and national security. However, one such conflict has remained in the shadows until now. <i>JFK vs. Allen Dulles: Battleground Indonesia </i>takes reader to the vast archipelago 3350 miles wide where this secret showdown occurred.<br><br> In 1936, an Allen Dulles-established company discovered the world's largest gold deposit in remote Netherlands New Guinea. In 1962, President Kennedy intervened, and Netherlands New Guinea was added to President Sukarno's Indonesia. Neither Sukarno nor JFK was aware of the gold, since Dulles had not informed Kennedy.<br><br> Dulles planned a complicated and ruthless CIA regime-change strategy to seize control not only of Indonesia itself, but also of its vast resources, including the gold. This strategy included a push to start Malaysian Confrontation. Yet Kennedy's plan to visit Jakarta in early 1964 would have sunk Dulles' master plan, which included the destruction of the Indonesian communist party as a wedge to split Moscow and Beijing. Only an assassin's bullet put an end to Kennedy&#x2019;s plan of peace. Did Allen Dulles arrange for JFK to be killed to save his plan and his gold? Was his coup for gold successful with JFK out of the picture?<br><br> Using archival records as a basis, Greg Poulgrain adds word-of-mouth evidence from those people who were directly involved&#x2014;such as Dean Rusk and others who worked with President Kennedy and Allen Dulles at the time; or the person who was with Michael Rockefeller when he mysteriously disappeared in West New Guinea during this whole affair.</p><p><b>Dr. Greg Poulgrain</b> is the author of three other books about Indonesia, including <i>T</i><i>he Genesis of Konfrontasi</i><i>&#x2014;</i><i>Malaysia, Brunei and Indonesia 1945-1965</i>.

A town named Pearl, assembled and presided over by the aptly named Patera, is the setting for his hallucinatory vision of a society founded on instinct over reason. Culminating apocalyptically - plagues of insects, mountains of corpses and orgies in the street - it is worth reading for its dizzying surrealism alone. Though ostensibly a gothic macabre fantasy, it is tempting to read The Other Side as a satire on the reactionary, idealist utopianism evident in German thought in the early twentieth century, highly prescient in its gloom, given later developments. The language often suggests Nietsche. The inevitable collapse of Patera's creation is lent added horror by hindsight. Kubin's depiction of absurd bureaucracy is strongly reminiscent of Kafka's The Trial, and his flawed utopia, situated next to a settlement of supposed savages, brings to mind Huxley's Brave New World; it precedes both novels, and this superb new translation could demonstrate its influence on subsequent modern literature.'<br><br>Kieron Pim in Time Out<br><br>It will appeal to fans of Mervyn Peake and readers who like the darkly decadent, the fantastic and the grotesque in their reading.</p><p>Alfred Kubin (1877-1959) was one of the major graphic artists of the 20th century who was widely known for his illustrations of writers of the fantastic such as Balzac, E.T.A. Hoffmann, Gustav Meyrink and Edgar Allan Poe, of whom he illustrated at least 50 books. In his combination of the darkly decadent, the fantastic and the grotesque, in his evocations of dream and nightmare, his creation of an atmosphere of mystery and fear he resembles Mervyn Peake. The Other Side (1908) is his only work of fiction.My poor wife found it impossible to overcome these fits of anxiety. She grew visibly paler, her cheeks more and more sunken, and at every unexpected word I spoke she would give a nervous start. Things could not go on like this much longer, and it was only the fact that I had still not managed to see Patera that delayed our departure. Without his specific permission any thought of leaving the Dream Realm was futile. The Archive contained ten requests I had submitted, but the only replies they deigned to send were a few stilted excuses such as, 'The time in question falls within a period of feriation for the Audience Bureau', or 'The petitioner has repeatedly been advised that a respectable position in society is a sine qua non for the granting of an audience. He is recommended, therefore, to maintain an ordered way of life, the which he should . . .' etc., etc. I was seething, and determined to open my friend's eyes to the harm caused by this pernicious bureaucratic clique. 'They'll be sorry for it!'<br><br>There was another thing that weighed against our journey home: Our money was gone! Yes, simply gone! Not a single copper was left from the hundred thousand marks.<br><br>'Well, there we have it, I knew it would happen,' I said bitterly to my wife when I found out. It was not really her fault, poor thing, so I spared her any further wailing and gnashing of teeth. Theft or no theft, the money had disappeared and all we had to live on was what I could earn.<br><br>This was towards the end of our second year in the Dream Realm. Now my wife began to be tormented by fears during the daytime as well. The kitchen was at the back of our flat and looked out through a window onto the courtyard of the dairy; in the middle was a well-shaft, at the back a few stable doors.<br><br>'That well is haunted', she insisted. She claimed she had heard strange hissing and knocking noises. I had noticed nothing, but to keep her happy I decided I should have a look, and so I went. Under the pretence that I wanted to look round the dairy I knocked until a half-deaf dairyman came to the door. A juicy tip quickly cured his dull-wittedness. I could look at whatever I liked, he shouted in my ear, before returning to his cubbyhole. Left to myself, I had no difficulty in setting about my investigation.</p><h2>Letter Perfect: The Marvelous History of Our Alphabet From A to Z</h2><p>A fun, lively, and learned excursion into the alphabet&#x2014;and cultural history.<br><br>Letters are tangible language.

In the 1924 translation, Fritz Hopman adapted, reduced and altered the Dutch edition&#x2014;softening Huizinga's passionate arguments, dulling his nuances, and eliminating theoretical passages. He dropped many passages Huizinga had quoted in their original old French. Additionally, chapters were rearranged, all references were dropped, and mistranslations were introduced.<br><br>This translation corrects such errors, recreating the second Dutch edition which represents Huizinga's thinking at its most important stage.

This new translation will no doubt bring Huizinga and his pioneering work back into the discussion of historical interpretation." &#x2014;Rosamond McKitterick, <i>New York Times Book Review</i></p><p>In 1919, Johan Huizinga revealed in the original version of this book that the ideals, aspirations, and behaviors of humanity in history were dramatically different from those in present day. In Herfsttjj der Middeleeuwen, he recalled the waning years of the Middle Ages--the low countries in northern Europe in the 14th and 15th centuries--and argued against those who claimed that human belief systems remain the same even if contexts change. His account rested not on historical fact, but on the emotions and ambitions of the people as expressed through the art and literature of their culture. Many people treated the book as groundbreaking work, and it was translated into English in 1924. This new translation is a complete, more direct version of the original and allows modern readers a full appreciation of life in an era rarely revisited.So begins one of the most famous works of history ever published, Johan Huizinga&#39;s The Autumn of the Middle Ages. Few who have read this book in English realize that The Waning of the Middle Ages, the only previous translation, is vastly different from the original Dutch, and incompatible with all other European-language translations. Now, for the first time ever, the original version of this classic work has been translated into English. Herfsttij der Middeleeuwen, or The Autumn of the Middle Ages - the original title - is a brilliant portrait of life, thought, and art in fourteenth- and fifteenth- century France and the Netherlands. For Huizinga, this period marked not the birth of a dramatically new era in history, the Renaissance, but the fullest, ripest phase of medieval life and thought. Criticized both at home and in Europe for being &#34;old-fashioned&#34; and &#34;too literary&#34; when first published in 1919, the book is now recognized not only for its quality and richness as history, but also as a precursor to the Annales &#34;histoire des mentalites&#34; school of Marc Bloch and Lucien Febvre, two of the few reviewers who praised the book initially. In the 1924 translation, Fritz Hopman adapted, reduced, and altered the Dutch edition - softening Huizinga&#39;s often passionate arguments, dulling his nuances, and eliminating theoretical passages. He dropped many passages Huizinga had quoted in their original old French. Additionally, chapters are rearranged and redivided, all references are dropped, and mistranslations are introduced. This translation corrects such errors, recreating the second Dutch edition - which represents Huizinga&#39;s thinking at its most important stage - as closely as possible.Everything that was dropped or rearranged has been restored. Prose quotations appear in French, with translations printed at the bottom of the page. Mistranslations have been corrected. Payton and Mammitzsch also have added helpful material, including Huizinga&#39;s preface to the first and second Dutch editions (published in 1919 and 1921) and the one to the 1924 German translation, where he touches on the book&#39;s title and offers some thoughts on translations. Several notes clarify Huizinga&#39;s references to things which would be common knowledge only to Dutch readers. Huizinga frequently refers to paintings, sculptures, and carvings, some little known; this edition is the first in any language to include a full range of illustrations.</p><h2>Loose Leaf for Nester&#39;s Microbiology: A Human Perspective</h2><p><p>Perfect for the non-major/allied health student (and also appropriate for mixed majors courses), this text provides a rock solid foundation in microbiology.

Published in 1912, it was, Bernard Berenson told Henry Adams, "better than any previous work excepting <i>Ethan Frome."</i> <br> A challenge to the moral climate of the day, <i>The Reef</i> follows the fancies of George Darrow, a young diplomat en route from London to France, intent on proposing to the widowed Anna Leath. Unsettled by Anna's reticence, Darrow drifts into an affair with Sophy Viner, a charmingly naive and impecunious young woman whose relations with Darrow and Anna's family threaten his prospects for success. <br> For its dramatic construction and acute insight into social mores and the multifaceted problem of sexuality, <i>The Reef</i> stands as one of Edith Wharton's most daring works of fiction.</p><p>America's most famous woman of letters, and the first woman to win the Pulitzer Prize, <b>Edith Wharton</b> was born into one of the last "leisured class" families in New York City, as she put it, in 1862. Educated privately, she was married to Edward Wharton in 1885, and for the next few years, they spent their time in the high society of Newport (Rhode Island), then Lenox (Massachusetts) and Europe. It was in Europe that Wharton first met Henry James, who was to have a profound and lasting influence on her life and work. Wharton's first published book was a work of nonfiction, in collaboration with Ogden Codman, <i>The Decoration of Houses</i> (1897), but from early on, her marriage had been a source of distress, and she was advised by her doctor to write fiction to relieve her nervous tension. Wharton's first short stories appeared in <i>Scribner's Magazine,</i> and though she published several volumes of fiction around the turn of the century, including <i>The Greater Inclination</i> (1899), <i>The Touchstone</i> (1900), <i>Crucial Instances</i> (1901), <i>The Valley of Decision</i> (1902), <i>Sanctuary</i> (1903), and <i>The Descent of Man and Other Stories</i> (1904), it wasn't until 1905, with the publication of the bestselling <i>The House of Mirth,</i> that she was recognized as one of the most important novelists of her time for her keen social insight and subtle sense of satire. In 1906, Wharton visited Paris, which inspired <i>Madame de Treymes</i> (1907), and made her home there in 1907, finally divorcing her husband in 1912. The years before the outbreak of World War I represent the core of her artistic achievement, when <i>Ethan Frome</i> (1911), <i>The Reef</i> (1912), and <i>The Custom of the Country</i> (1913) were published. During the war, she remained in France organizing relief for Belgian refugees, for which she was later awarded the Legion of Honor. She also wrote two novels about the war, <i>The Marne</i> (1918) and <i>A Son at the Front</i> (1923), and continued, in France, to write about New England and the Newport society she had known so well in <i>Summer</i> (1917), the companion to <i>Ethan Frome,</i> and <i>The Age of Innocence</i> (1920), for which she won the Pulitzer Prize. Wharton died in France in 1937. Her other works include <i>Old New York</i> (1924), <i>The Mother's Recompense</i> (1925), <i>The Writing of Fiction</i> (1925), <i>The Children</i> (1928), <i>Hudson River Bracketed</i> (1929), and her autobiography, <i>A Backward Glance</i> (1934).Edith Wharton was at the height of her enormous literary powers when she published The Reef in 1912, and everything about this novel suggests a mastery so complete that it can achieve nothing higher. The plot, which tells of the drastic effects of a casual sexual betrayal on the lives of four Americans in France, is expertly turned, suspenseful, continually compelling. An assured, unhurried dramatic instinct governs the great moments of confrontation and revelation. The central characters, two of whom are innocents and two of whom are burdened by experience and tinged with desperation, are perfectly delineated: their relationships to one another are constructed with a classical feeling for harmony, proportion, and balance. And the entire novel is imbued with a clear-eyed wisdom about both the possibilities and the limitations of human love. Wharton would go on to write splendid books after completing The Reef, but nowhere does she display a finer command of her art than she does here.</p><h2>It&#39;s Good to Be Queen: Becoming as Bold, Gracious, and Wise as the Queen of Sheba</h2><p><b><b>Sheba journeyed across the desert with a caravan of riches, only to find the greatest treasure of them all&#x2014;and so can you.&nbsp;</b><br></b><br>When it comes to famous queens of the Bible, we know the good one, Queen Esther, and the bad one, Queen Jezebel.

Yet, until now, the Comanche empire has gone unrecognized in American history.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This compelling and original book uncovers the lost story of the Comanches.

Egerton offers a sweeping chronicle of African American history stretching from Britain's 1763 victory in the Seven Years' War to the election of slaveholder Thomas Jefferson as president in 1800. While American slavery is usually identified with antebellum cotton plantations, Egerton shows that on the eve of the Revolution it encompassed everything from wading in the South Carolina rice fields to carting goods around Manhattan to serving the households of Boston's elite. More important, he recaptures the drama of slaves, freed blacks, and white reformers fighting to make the young nation fulfill its republican slogans. Although this struggle often unfolded in the corridors of power, Egerton pays special attention to what black Americans did for themselves in these decades, and his narrative brims with compelling portraits of forgotten African American activists and rebels, who battled huge odds and succeeded in finding liberty--if never equality--only in northern states. Egerton concludes that despite the real possibility of peaceful, if gradual, emancipation, the Founders ultimately lacked the courage to end slavery.<br></p><p><br><strong>Douglas R.

Davis, <em>Publishers Weekly</em><p></p><br>"The monumental accomplishments of Founding Fathers like Thomas Jefferson and George Washington seem trivial in comparison to what many of their African American contemporaries achieved. Seizing the unprecedented opportunities presented by the Revolutionary War, thousands of enslaved Americans--including slaves owned by Jefferson and Washington--made their own declarations of independence and undertook the arduous and perilous journey from slave to freedom. Now, for the first time, the scores of recent investigations of black participation in the American Revolution have been synthesized into an elegant and seamless narrative. In <em>Death or Liberty</em>--a title taken not from Patrick Henry but from a participant in Gabriel's Rebellion in 1800--Douglas Egerton shows that African Americans not only extracted the most liberty from the Revolutionary experience but also paid the highest price for it."--Woody Holton, University of Richmond<p></p><br>"Slowly, American understanding of the vital Revolutionary era is becoming more open, subtle, and realistic.

These solutions move EMDR forward and expand the application of this powerful therapeutic approach. In this source book of therapeutic strategy and clinical insight, each chapter presents step-by-step instructions for implementing a particular EMDR solution with clients. Each intervention is enriched with relevant case histories that bring to life new targets for and variations on the standard EMDR protocol. Concrete and specific, the clinical work illustrated here will add to you fund of knowledge and broaden your practice.</p><p>Robin Shapiro has gathered a stellar group of EMDR practitioners. Each of the contributors offers key therapeutic insights in an easy-to-digest form:<br> - Maureen Kitchur presents her Strategic Developmental Model, a meta-model for EMDR practice that encompasses all phases of the Standard Protocol, Ericksonian utilization language, and attachment-enhancing practices. Kitchur's model gives a clear order for EMDR processing and a way to process wordless or implicit experience.<br> - Roy Kiessling offers his Resource Development strategies. Easy to learn and very helpful for clients who are disorganized or in crisis, Kiessling's methods turn resources into cognitive interweaves and ego states into resources.<br> - Sandra Wilson and Robert Tinker demonstrate an effective treatment for phantom limb pain that encompasses treatment from history taking through processing to "It's gone!"<br> - A. J. Popky turns the Subjective Units of Distress scale (SUDS) on its head by targeting inappropriate positive affect. Popky also shares his DeTUR protocol with its Level of Urge to Use (LOUU) for the treatment of addictions and compulsive behavior.<br> - Jim Knipe builds on Popky's work with the SUDS and presents techniques for clearing love-sickness, procrastination, avoidance and codependence using the Level of Urge to Avoid (LOUA).<br> - Joanne Twombly and Ulrich Lanius teach two very different preparations for doing EMDR with people with dissociative disorders. Twombly's applies techniques derived from hypnosis and ego-state work while Lanius shows how to use opiate-inhibiting medication to allow EMDR to work with dissociated clients.<br> - Robin Shapiro addresses the Two-Hand Interweave, a simple but widely applicable exercise of discernment. Shapiro also contributes chapters on using EMDR with anxiety disorders, in differentiation-based couple's therapy and with generational and cultural introjects.<br> - Elizabeth Turner engages children with art therapy, play therapy, and story telling in all phases of EMDR. Her chapter is the delightful cherry on top of this informative, easy-to-use book.<br> Additional chapters by Carole Lovell, Andrew Seubert, Jim Cole, and Susan Schulherr address EMDR with dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) with borderline clients, working with mentally retarded clients, a reenactment tool from guided imagery, and the binge/starve cycle of eating disorders.<br><br> Whether you read EMDR Solutions cover-to-cover or peruse one chapter that speaks to a particular technique or client population, you will be adding crucial skills and knowledge to your EMDR toolbox.&nbsp;</p></p><p>Robin Shapiro, MSW, LICSW, the editor of two EMDR Solutions books and The Trauma Treatment Handbook, is in private practice in Seattle.

He then argues that what we term the &#x201c;Age of Reason&#x201d; was in fact the beginning of the eclipse of reason&#x2019;s authority as a cultural value.

Across the Wide Missouri tells the compelling story of the climax and decline of the Rocky Mountain fur trade during the 1830s. More than a history, it portrays the mountain fur trade as a way of business and a way of life, vividly illustrating how it shaped the expansion of the American West.</p><p>Like many U.S. historians, cultural critic Bernard DeVoto believed that the American character was rooted in the experience of westward expansion. Unlike those who championed the civilizing graces of the agrarian frontier, however, DeVoto drew inspiration from the mercenary, imperial designs of the fur trade. Originally published in 1947, <i>Across the Wide Missouri</i>is arguably the best known of his studies in American history, examining the rise and fall of the U.S. fur dynasties in the 1830s. The book chronicles the competition between John Jacob Astor's American Fur Company and the Rocky Mountain Fur Company, an "opposition" group of trappers (including Jim Bridger and Kit Carson) descended from the earlier entrepreneurial activities of General William H. Ashley. Devoto specifically narrates the major expeditions and the daily experiences of the Western divisions of these companies, which scoured the northernmost regions of the Rocky Mountains for beaver. He contends that, by exploring the recently charted Northern plateau, fighting off interlopers, and setting up trade networks, the loose confederation of trappers, traders, and Native Americans shaped the materialism that typifies modern American society. In his densely detailed description of the company "rendezvous," DeVoto shows how the activities of trading, partying, and resource pooling created a shared experience for competing cultural and economic parties on the frontier. While the centrality of the fur trade in the development of the American character may strike some readers as overemphasized, DeVoto's thesis still carries much relevance for modern American studies. <i>--John M. Anderson</i>Bernard DeVoto (1897-1955), winner of the Pulitzer Prize, was a renowned scholar-historian of the American West and one of the country&#39;s greatest men of letters.</p><h2>The Numerology of the I Ching: A Sourcebook of Symbols, Structures, and Traditional Wisdom</h2><p>The first book to cover the complete Taoist teachings on form, structure, and symbol in the I Ching. <br><br>� Provides many new patterns and diagrams for visualizing the layout of the 64 hexagrams. <br><br>� Includes advanced teachings on the hosts of the hexagrams, the mutual hexagrams, and the core hexagrams. <br><br>� Written by Taoist Master Alfred Huang, author of <i>The Complete I Ching</i>. <br><br><i>The Numerology of the I Ching</i> is the first book to bring the complete Taoist teachings on form, structure, and symbol in the I Ching to a Western audience, and it is a natural complement to Alfred Huang's heralded <i>Complete I Ching</i>.

Drawing on recently discovered historical, literary, and linguistic evidence, C. S. Mann proposes the controversial theory that Mark followed the Gospels of Matthew and Luke, and that it is a digest of those two other Synoptic Gospels. Lay readers and serious students of the Bible may disagree with Mann, but they cannot ignore his theory.<br><br>The Gospel of Mark presents an action-packed, nonstop picture of Jesus' public life. Here we encounter the humanity of Jesus, and the secrecy shrouding his divine nature. Through his lively translation and insightful commentary, Mann clearly explains the central message of Mark's Gospel: The power of faith and hope that moves the Christian community toward ultimate glory in the coming of the Lord and His Kingdom rests in the triumph of the suffering Christ.<br><br>The themes in Mark -- the suffering of Jesus, the liberation of the oppressed, the search for community, and the healing power of Christ -- echo the turbulent times during which he wrote this Gospel. The unthinkable destruction of Jerusalem by the Roman army, the persecution of early followers of Jesus, and the rampant obsession with the end of the world are reflected in Mark's stories and parables.</p><p>C.

Eusebius chronicles the events of the first three centuries of the Christian church in such a way as to record a vast number of vital facts about early Christianity that can be learned from no other ancient source. When Eusebius wrote his Ecclesiastical History, his vital concern was to record facts before they disappeared, and before eye-witnesses were killed and libraries were burned and destroyed in persecutions by Rome. He faithfully transcribed the most important existing documents of his day so that future generations would have a collection of factual data to interpret. Thus Eusebius (c. A.D. 260-340) richly deserves the title "father of Church history."</p><p>"More readable."

Using conversational language, the textbook walks readers through the lives and works of history&#39;s greatest philosophers, and then brings it all together with helpful study materials in every chapter. By starting with what philosophers actually wrote, then explaining the latest philosophical critiques, ARCHETYPES OF WISDOM: AN INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY, 8E makes studying philosophy approachable and exciting.</p><p>Douglas Soccio was professor of philosophy at Shasta College for nearly 30 years. In addition to ARCHETYPES OF WISDOM: AN INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY, 9E, he is the author of HOW TO GET THE MOST OUT OF PHILOSOPHY, and, with Vincent E. Barry, PRACTICAL LOGIC, all of which are published by Cengage Learning. For three years he wrote a weekly philosophy column for the REDDING RECORD SEARCHLIGHT. Now devoted to writing on a full-time basis, he is presently developing a collection of philosophical stories that express what he describes as &#34;philosophy with a heart,&#34; a generous notion of philosophy that infuses all of his writing."Soccio's pedagogy and methodology are masterful. I have used this text in several incarnations starting with the second edition. I keep coming back to it because it makes my job easier. He works hard to make things clear to beginners without obvious 'dumbing down.' College students notice when they are being condescended to, and it destroys their motivation."<br><br>"The writing style here is appropriate. It has a good flow, and uses language familiar to students. It helps students apply the more abstract ideas they have just read about, which makes it more likely the ideas will be learned."<br><br>"I quite like the philosophical queries and the author's use of questions that help the student to reflect upon the issues and their relevance for thinking about current issues. It keeps philosophy a living subject."</p><h2>Music for Sightsinging, Sixth Edition</h2><p>Blending step-by-step guidance with frequent practice, this book helps readers cultivate an understanding of sight singing and acquire the necessary skills to hear mentally a piece of printed music <i>without</i> using an instrument. Arranging its 21 chapters to study both pitch and rhythm, this book presents melodies and exercises that enable readers to develop the skills of reading pitch, reading rhythm, and combining these two essential elements. The Sixth Edition contains nearly 1200 melodies taken from a wide spectrum of music literature and the world's folk music. For professionals with a career in music, music education, and composition.</p><p><p> <i>Music for Sight Singing</i> provides music examples for practice in accomplishing the sight singing goals described on the first page of the text. The principal objective of the study is to acquire the ability to sing a given melody at first .sight. Once sung, that melody no longer qualifies to satisfy its purpose, though repetition is valuable in reviewing errors. Thus, a large number of melodies (nearly 1,200 in this volume) is desirable to provide enough practice material to accomplish the "first sight" requirement. </p> <p> So that the sight singing materials will provide a musical satisfaction greater than that from routine exercises, the melodies in this text are carefully chosen from the literature of composed music and a wide range of the world's folk music. Music examples written especially for pedagogical purposes are kept to a minimum. All materials are graded so that the student is presented with just one musical problem, rhythmic or melodic, at a time. In a given melody, only those musical elements presented in its chapter or in previous chapters will be found. To facilitate the presentation of either element&#x2014;pitch or rhythm&#x2014;the opening examples of each chapter will make use only of the simplest materials of the other element.</p> <p> Prerequisite to the study of sight singing is a working knowledge of the basic aspects of music theory, these often taught from materials with titles such as "Introduction," "Rudiments," or "Fundamentals." In the area of pitch, these are especially important: (1) the ability to spell, write, and sing all major and minor scales; (2) the ability to write all major and minor key signatures; and (3) the ability to recognize the key from a given key signature. In the area of rhythm, a knowledge of note values and the interpretation of time (meter) signatures is necessary. Much of this information will be reviewed as the need occurs throughout the text. However, bringing to the opening studies a comprehensive and usable knowledge of these basic materials will guarantee more immediate accomplishment of sight-reading goals. </p> <p> The text as a whole may be considered as consisting of four parts: </p> <ol> <li>Chapters 1-9, diatonic melodies with rhythmic patterns limited to beat-note values and their simplest divisions (simple time, two per beat; compound time, three per beat).</li> <li>Chapters 10-12, rhythmic studies and diatonic melodies that include subdivisions of the beat value.</li> <li>Chapters 13-19, chromaticism, modulation, and more advanced rhythmic problems.</li> <li>Chapters 20-21, the medieval modes and twentieth-century melodic lines.</li> </ol> <p> The principal features of previous editions remain unchanged. Improvement in this sixth edition include (1) some fifty new melodies, many in the areas of chromaticism, while considerably fewer have been deleted; (2) additional explanatory material for such subjects as "hemiola," and "Neapolitan sixth chords"; and (3) in many chapters, melodies relocated to present smoother progression from easy to difficult within the chapter. </p> <p> <i>Robert W. Ottman</i> </p></p><h2>Eichmann in Jerusalem</h2><p>Hannah Arendt's authoritative report on the trial of Nazi leader Adolf Eichmann includes further factual material that came to light after the trial, as well as Arendt's postscript directly addressing the controversy that arose over her account.<br><br></p><p>While living in Argentina in 1960, Nazi leader Adolf Eichmann was kidnapped and smuggled to Israel where he was put on trial for crimes against humanity. The <i>New Yorker</i> magazine sent Hannah Arendt to cover the trial. While covering the technical aspects of the trial, Arendt also explored the wider themes inherent in the trial, such as the nature of justice, the behavior of the Jewish leadership during the Nazi R�gime, and, most controversially, the nature of Evil itself. <p> Far from being evil incarnate, as the prosecution painted Eichmann, Arendt maintains that he was an average man, a petty bureaucrat interested only in furthering his career, and the evil he did came from the seductive power of the totalitarian state and an unthinking adherence to the Nazi cause. Indeed, Eichmann's only defense during the trial was "I was just following orders." </p><p> Arendt's analysis of the seductive nature of evil is a disturbing one. We would like to think that anyone who would perpetrate such horror on the world is different from us, and that such atrocities are rarities in our world. But the history of groups such as the Jews, Kurds, Bosnians, and Native Americans, to name but a few, seems to suggest that such evil is all too commonplace. In revealing Eichmann as the pedestrian little man that he was, Arendt shows us that the veneer of civilization is a thin one indeed.</p>Hannah Arendt (1906-1975) was an influential German political theorist and philosopher whose works include The Origins of Totalitarianism, The Human Condition, and Eichmann in Jerusalem.</p><h2>Judge Dee at Work: Eight Chinese Detective Stories (Judge Dee Mysteries)</h2><p><p> </p><p>The eight short stories in <i>Judge Dee at Work</i> cover a decade during which the judge served in four different provinces of the T&#x2019;ang Empire. From the suspected treason of a general in the Chinese army to the murder of a lonely poet in his garden pavilion, the cases here are among the most memorable in the Judge Dee series.</p> <p></p></p><p><p></p><p><b></b></p><b>Robert van Gulik </b>(1910&#x2013;67) was a Dutch diplomat and an authority on Chinese history and culture.

It immediately became a bestseller, and Stephen Crane became famous. Crane set out to create "a psychological portrayal of fear." Henry Fleming, a Union Army volunteer in the Civil War, thinks "that perhaps in a battle he might run....As far as war was concerned he knew nothing of himself." And he does run in his first battle, full of fear and then remorse. He encounters a grotesquely rotting corpse propped against a tree, and a column of wounded men, one of whom is a friend who dies horribly in front of him. Fleming receives his own "red badge" when a fellow soldier hits him in the head with a gun.

But who decides what is necessary for the public good, and is it really true that any kind of service is permissible for the public good? These questions are at the heart of James M. Olson&#x2019;s book, <i>Fair Play: The Moral Dilemmas of Spying</i>.<br><br> Olson, a veteran of the CIA&#x2019;s clandestine service, takes readers inside the real world of intelligence to describe the difficult dilemmas that field officers face on an almost daily basis. Far from being a dry theoretical treatise, this fascinating book uses actual intelligence operations to illustrate how murky their moral choices can be. Readers will be surprised to learn that the CIA provides very little guidance on what is, or is not, permissible. Rather than empowering field officers, the author has found that this lack of guidelines actually hampers operations. Olson believes that U.S. intelligence officers need clearer moral guidelines to make correct, quick decisions. Significantly, he believes these guidelines should come from the American public, not from closed-door meetings inside the intelligence community. <i>Fair Play</i> will encourage a broad public debate about the proper moral limits on U.S. intelligence activities.</p><p><p>"You've heard of business ethics, medical ethics, even journalistic ethics? Spying ethics predictably took a little longer to come in from the cold. Yet <i>Fair Play</i> could well become the anchoring text of a new field. As sharp as a stiletto-fitted umbrella, as tough as can be, Olson proves remarkably humane about how to balance dirty tricks with high ideals. He brings startling clarity to issues of official lying and worse." --<b>Carlin Romano, <i>Philadelphia Inquirer</i>, Sunday, February 11, 2007</b> </p><p>"A thoughtful, provocative analysis of practically every possible moral dilemma that is ever likely to prick the conscience of an assiduous case officer. The scenarios presented by James Olson, himself a veteran insider, have the authentic whiff of cordite that suggest little has been drawn from his imagination, but much has been looted from the operational files." -- <b>Nigel West, author of <i>The Third Secret: The CIA, Solidarity and the KGB's Plot to Kill the Pope</i></b> </p><p>"James Olson is a legend in the clandestine service, having served in some of the most difficult, dangerous, and complicated assignments at the height of the Cold War. As director of central intelligence, I trusted him without reservation when he was chief of counterintelligence not only because he was enormously capable but also because I knew he thought deeply about the ethical and moral dimensions of what we did every day. Amid the countless books and memoirs of retired spies, especially at this time, this one is essential reading." -- <b>Robert M. Gates, Director of Central Intelligence, 1991-1993</b> </p><p>"Under veteran intelligence officer James Olson's sure direction, the reader enters a world few Americans ever see or even know exists. From his insightful summary of intelligence history through each of his fifty reality-based scenarios, he confronts the difficult ethical issues head-on. An unprecedented examination of the challenging moral dilemmas of human intelligence operations, Olson's work will soon be the standard reference." -- <b>Peter Earnest, executive director, International Spy Museum, and former CIA officer</b> </p><p>"James Olson has deftly plumbed the depths of the spy's dilemma: How can one spend a lifetime practicing deception and still retain a strong moral compass? <i>Fair Play</i> is the primer on how to balance a little bit of evil so it will yield the maximum benefit to the common good. A must read." --<b>Antonio J. Mendez, former CIA officer and author of <i>The Master of Disguise: My Secret Life in the CIA</i></b> </p><p>"Do the ends ever justify the means? CIA veteran James Olson explores the complex choices, limitations, and moral dilemmas facing U.S. intelligence officers who attempt to operate within an ill-defined standard of `acceptable moral behavior.' Fascinating and thought provoking, <i>Fair Play</i> will become a must-read for officers on the frontlines of the global war on terror. There isn't anything else like it!" --<b>H. Keith Melton, intelligence historian and author of <i>Ultimate Spy</i></b> </p><p>"James Olson, a retired operations officer cum teacher and author, has given the literature of intelligence one of its most interesting, unusual, and forthright books." -- <b>Hayden Peake, Historical Intelligence Collection, CIA, printed with permission from the reviewer in the Association of Former Intelligence Officers Newsletter</b> </p><p>"<i>Fair Play</i> is an eye-opener to the average American citizen like me who just assumed that the rules were pretty much set in concrete. Nothing could be farther from the truth...Olson's book will lead to discussions in our nation that will lead to better defined 'rules of engagement' for our CIA case officers." --<b>Michael Caudle, <i>Military Ink</i></b></p>I was born and raised in Iowa.

Book Council</p></p><p>Michael Hays is the illustrator of several books for children, including <em>Abiyoyo</em> by Pete Seeger and <em>Hello, Tree!</em> by Joanne Ryder. He lives in Oak Park, IL.When we count, we say &#34;one, two, three ... &#34; but it is possible to count without using numbers at all. Perhaps instead we could just point to different parts of our body to represent varying amounts. Pointing to our left shoulder would mean nine, while pointing to our right eye would mean 15. This type of body counting is how the Paiela, the people of the highlands of Papua New Guinea, count. They have no special words for numbers. Another people, the Veddas of Sri Lanka, also count without numbers. They pile up pebbles to represent the objects: one pebble for each object. They have a few special counting words meaning things such as &#34;a single,&#34; &#34;a couple,&#34; &#34;another one&#34; and &#34;many.&#34; In this book, author Schmandt-Besserat draws from her background as an archaeologist and takes us through the early counting techniques of the ancient Middle East to witness the evolution of our modern-day method. Try your hand at counting the way the ancient Sumerians did and experience a world without zero. Try to count like the ancient Greeks and learn the 27 letters of their alphabet that they used as numerals. After short experiments with these techniques, the advantages of the modern system become clear. You&#39;ll never look at numbers in quite the same way again.</p><h2>Healing: Bringing the Gift of God&#39;s Mercy to the World</h2><p><i>"Lord, I am not worthy to have you enter under my roof; only say the word and my servant will be healed."</i> - Matthew 8:8<p></p><p>When we, or a family member or friend, are faced with an injury or illness, physical or emotional, our thoughts turn to God in prayer for healing.

Where there is an increase in women's university enrollment rates, women's earnings, and maternal health, and a reduction in violence against women, we see more prosperous communities, better educated, healthier families, and the preservation of equal human rights. Yet globally, women remain the most consistently under-utilized resource. <i>Vital Voices</i> calls for and makes possible transformative leadership around the world.</p> <p>In <i>Vital Voices</i>, CEO Alyse Nelson shares the stories of remarkable, world-changing women, as well as the story of how Vital Voices was founded, crossing lines that typically divide.

Stories collected in this Library of America volume (the second of five volumes of James&#x2019;s stories) show James working out, in a more concise fictional laboratory, themes that appear in such novels of the period as&nbsp;<i>The Portrait of a Lady</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>The Bostonians</i>. They include some of his most famous explorations of the international theme: &#x201c;Daisy Miller,&#x201d; the unforgettable portrayal of an innocent, headstrong American girl at odds with European mores, &#x201c;An International Episode&#x201d; and &#x201c;Lady Barberina,&#x201d; satirically probing tales of English aristocrats and the American marriage market, and &#x201c;The Siege of London,&#x201d; in which an American widow strives to work her way into English society.<br><br>In &#x201c;A Bundle of Letters&#x201d; and &#x201c;The Point of View,&#x201d; James makes a fascinating experimental use of the epistolary form. &#x201c;Professor Fargo&#x201d; presents an unusually bleak view of the darker side of American life, while &#x201c;The Author of &#x2018;Beltraffio&#x2019;&#x201d; offers a disturbing portrait of a fin-de-si�cle novelist.

He lived in Newport, went briefly to Harvard Law School, and in 1864 began to contribute both criticism and tales to magazines.<p>In 1869, and then in 1872-74, he paid visits to Europe and began his first novel, <b>Roderick Hudson</b>. Late in 1875 he settled in Paris, where he met Turgenev, Flaubert, and Zola, and wrote <b>The American</b> (1877). In December 1876 he moved to London, where two years later he achieved international fame with <b>Daisy Miller</b>. Other famous works include <b>Washington Square</b> (1880), <b>The Portrait of a Lady</b> (1881), <b>The Princess Casamassima</b> (1886), <b>The Aspern Papers</b> (1888), <b>The Turn of the Screw</b> (1898), and three large novels of the new century, <b>The Wings of the Dove</b> (1902), <b>The Ambassadors</b> (1903) and <b>The Golden Bowl</b> (1904). In 1905 he revisited the United States and wrote <b>The American Scene</b> (1907).</p><p>During his career he also wrote many works of criticism and travel. Although old and ailing, he threw himself into war work in 1914, and in 1915, a few months before his death, he became a British subject. In 1916 King George V conferred the Order of Merit on him.

Forced to flee Boston, she goes undercover as a governess for a prominent Puritan family. When outed by a nosy postmaster, she deserts the respectability of her position, dons a leotard and slippers, and poses as a Russian tightrope walker in a traveling circus. <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the law soon catches up with her, and prospects do not look good. Through her many adventures, Jacky has always found the ingenuity to escape dire situations, but this time it looks like Puss in Boots has run out of lives . . . and her happily-ever-after will be cut short at the foot of the gallows.</p></p><p><p><b>L. A. Meyer </b>(1942&#x2013;2014) was the acclaimed writer of the Bloody Jack Adventure series, which follows the exploits of an impetuous heroine who has fought her way up from the squalid streets of London to become an adventurer of the highest order. Mr. Meyer was an art teacher, an illustrator, a designer, a naval officer, and a gallery owner. All of those experiences helped him in the writing of his curious tales of the beloved Jacky Faber.

Well, dear, I felt it was a perfect place for me to go&#x2014;my daddy will never find me here. Thank you for introducing me to Mademoiselle Claudelle de Bourbon on my previous visit here, for through her I find I have entry to a very sporting class of people. Mam&#x2019;selle is well and great fun, of course, and sends her love and affection. And do not worry, I shall not again fall into dependence on those substances she is so eager to provide&#x2014;no, I am older and far wiser now.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is your Mr. Fletcher here by my side? Oh, you silly thing, don&#x2019;t you know that was an elaborate little joke? It was just a game. You do realize I had to pay you back for my loss of Randall, don&#x2019;t you? So now we&#x2019;re all even&#x2014;Polly Von can have both Randall and my part in your little play. That was amusing, but time for me to move on.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the very idea of me, Clarissa Worthington Howe, being married to a very junior British naval officer&#x2014;oh my dear, it just could not be. Oh, I mean he was most pleasant company on our way down to New York. We had many fine promenades on the deck as night fell, but I did find him a bit gloomy. I suspect he is still mooning over the loss of his pwetty widdle Jacky Faber. Oh well, he&#x2019;ll get over that. But oh! Oh! Oh! If you could have just seen the look on your face when our ship pulled away from the dock and you came running down to find James looking out to sea and me with my arm around his waist. Joy! I must say my timing was perfect! It was as perfect as that scene you staged back at Dovecote when I pulled up in my coach to find you and Randall rolling around on the grass, Randall above and you below, with your skirts up around your waist. Turnabout is fair play, right, Jacky?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, dear, thank you for introducing me to New Orleans, as the place suits me. I have taken rooms here at the Rising Sun, as it seems to be the center of all activity in this city, and I have found employment as a singer. I did have to post a bond with Madame Babineau, considering my past behavior here at the Rising Sun, silly stuff that I can scarcely recall. Anyway, I gave her a check in the amount of $500, written on the account of FaberShipping Worldwide, and she seemed pleased. You have probably noticed that one of your cunning little packets of checks is missing. Is it not the most wondrous thing, Jacky? I write out the amount and sign your name&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I will try to be careful with it.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you also for teaching me to play upon the guitar. With my good soprano voice and my beauty, of course, I am quite the hit. Could I be becoming you? Heaven forbid&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but, possibly&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;a well-bred, cultured, and beautiful version of you, maybe. You have shown me the way, Jacky, and I thank you for it&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;and for the loan of your guitar. I&#x2019;m sure you&#x2019;ll find another one soon.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for my beauty, my fame is spreading. I am performing in several theatrical productions and do not lack for money nor notice. As a matter of fact, I am to be escorted to a grand ball tonight by a General Jackson&#x2014;do you know him? He is friends with the Lafitte brothers, both of whom send their regards in hopes of seeing you again very soon. They were most emphatic on that.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And while we&#x2019;re on the subject of my beauty, if I were you, I would not go looking for the painting that Spanish boy did of you, as I have borrowed it, also. It has been beautifully framed and now hangs over the bar at the Rising Sun and is admired by all. The Lafitte brothers and I, together with Andrew, were just minutes ago standing in front of it, and all toasted you most warmly&#x2014;the resemblance is simply amazing. I swear Mam&#x2019;selle kneels in prayer before it every day. I cannot imagine why it upset your Mr. Fletcher so. After all, we have always known of your&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;exhibitionist tendencies.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Fletcher&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Oh, yes, you will probably want to know about him. We parted at New York and he took ship for England, while I continued on to New Orleans. I believe he will try to regain his commission in the Royal Navy, and I say good luck to him. Actually, I think he still loves you, poor man. I did, of course, intercept a letter to you that he had placed at the Pig, wherein he suggested a meeting of reconciliation between the two of you. Silly boy. I just could not allow that to happen. I enclose that letter with this one so that you might enjoy.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your piratical friend Flaco Jimenez was in New Orleans last week. I believe he came because he had heard I was here, and he showed me an excellent time. The Lafittes do not know all of the low dives in this town, but Flaco is familiar with all of them. He asks after you, of course, but has invited me to go a-roving with him. He might even give me my own ship. I must say the offer is most enticing and I might do it someday&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;The dread Pirate Howe&#x2014;it has a nice ring to it, don&#x2019;t you think?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night is very pleasantly warm and the air is heavily laden with the perfume of tropical flowers, and, oh, I do believe Andrew is here to escort me to the ball.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Till later, Jacky. Keep well. I do love you, you know, in my own way. I used to think you were something nasty stuck to the bottom of my shoe, but I have changed my mind on that. Since you have come into my life, you have been ever so much fun.</i><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Sincerely,</i><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Clarissa Worthington Howe</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Chapter 1</b></p><p>In the late summer of the year eighteen hundred and nine, we were just back from a fine Caribbean cruise on the <i>Nancy B. Alsop,</i> my lovely little two-mastedGloucester schooner&#x2014;sixty-five feet in length, thirty feet in the beam&#x2014;a fore-and-aft rig, and as sweet a sailor as ever did cleave an ocean wave. We angled in on a light, fair breeze toward our usual dockage on Boston&#x2019;s crowded waterfront. As we headed in, I noticed that the <i>Morning Star,</i> the larger of Faber Shipping&#x2019;s two dories, was not moored in her usual spot. Solomon Freeman probably had her out on the bay, hauling traps, but the <i>Evening Star</i> was tied to the floating dock.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I noticed also that the mighty British frigate HMS<i>Shannon</i> was moored alongside Broad Wharf. Well, fine. I am done with all that&#x2014;the British Navy, BritishIntelligence, young British officers, be they navy, or cavalry dragoons, or whatever.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that is for certain, as sure as my name is Jacky Faber. Though born in England, I sail under American colors, and my company, Faber Shipping Worldwide, is based in Boston, Massachusetts, USA. I am a free woman of nineteen years, and I owe no allegiance to any man, having vowed to live single all my life. My business thrives, and my many employees are happy with their lot, as I am with mine. I prosper and I am content.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After seeing the <i>Nancy B.</i> properly tied up, with her crew and passengers sent off to wives and sweethearts and other pursuits, I am headed back to the offices of Faber Shipping Worldwide to exchange reports of a business nature with my very able friend and lawyer Mr. EzraPickering. On the way there, I reflect on our latest cruise:</p><p>On this trip, I had taken along Joannie Nichols, my fourteen-�year-old ward and fellow Cheapside orphan, and she purely reveled in every minute of it, knowing full well she would have to go back to the Lawson Peabody School for Young Girls upon our return. She is most unwilling to return to those hallowed halls, to be sure, much preferring a life on the open sea, as do I; but she has made many friends there now, so it will not be so hard on her this time.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I no longer permit Joannie to bundle with Daniel Prescott, another member of my crew and her long-time beau, as I perceive her to be now fully grown and capable of getting herself into trouble. No, she is kicked upstairs to sleep in my cabin with me, as I need the nighttime company to ward off the nightmares and she needs to watch herself, for Mistress Pimm accepts only certified maidens in her school. I should know, having been closely grilled by Mistress on that very topic more than a few times in the past. <i>Yes, Mistress, no longer your student but still a maiden, and I shall remain forever so.</i><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Davy Jones is also on this trip, as well as his dear wife, Annie. So, with Joannie, Jemimah, Annie, Dorothea, and me, this was quite the petticoat crew. But I don&#x2019;t care&#x2014;it&#x2019;s my ship and I&#x2019;ll do what I want with her.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All in all, it has been an enjoyable cruise, and more and more each day, I am liking my new life free of males.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the others, I have my son, Ravi, by my side as ship&#x2019;s boy, both of us filled with joy at our reunion. After a few trips across the Big Salt on my brigantine <i>Lorelei Lee</i>&#x2014;to prevent him from being retaken by the Boston authorities and tossed back into that wretched boys&#x2019; reformatory&#x2014;he pronounces himself &#x201c;a true son of the sea, Memsahib, a sailor man skilled in many useful things. The clever Sinbad has not a single thing on sailor boy Ravi.&#x201d; He, too, must return to school soon, now that we&#x2019;ve docked in Boston, but in the meantime delights in showing his fellow <i>Lorelei</i> ship&#x2019;s boys around the town. They are told they may eat and drink their fill at the Pig and Whistle, but are warned against visits to Mrs. Bodeen&#x2019;s fancy house. Don&#x2019;t tell me I don&#x2019;t know ship&#x2019;s boys, as I once was one.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, yes, a lovely cruise, and one enjoyed to the fullest by Dorothea and Mr. Sackett, she being a former classmate of mine at the Lawson Peabody and he being a teacher at the same school. The two had been tossed out on their ears for the crime of marrying each other. Both are dedicated scientists and were in absolute glory over the richness of the fauna we had found in the warm waters of the Caribbean. Joannie and I delighted in getting back into our swimming suits and diving for specimens, as well as for dinner. Yes, plenty of lobsters, fish, and shrimp for our cook, Jemimah Moses, to work her magic on, but no more riches from the wreck of the <i>Santa Magdalena,</i> which had once yielded so much in the way of Spanish gold for the treasury of merry England&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;and for me. We look forward to more such voyages in the near future, and the Sacketts pronounce themselves delighted. I even plan a crossing of the Isthmus of Panama to explore the west coast of this continent. How I will accomplish that, I do not know. I do know, however, that I will <i>not</i> attempt to sail through Tierra del Fuego, down at the tip of South America, for I have heard too many stories of that fierce wind-blown passage. Plus, I do not like the cold.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps with the help of my leather-bound illustrations of their specimens, it is to be hoped that Mr. Sackett willfinally gain a position on the faculty of the college inCambridge, and maybe I will see some of the back rent they owe me, they being as poor as church mice. Hey, my illustrations worked for Dr. Sebastian back at the Royal Society in London; why not in New England? If not, the Sacketts will continue to travel with me, as I enjoy their company and their boundless enthusiasm for science and nature, and I have learned much from them as well. <i>Think of it as paying tuition, girl. You never know when it might come in handy.</i><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so it is with no small measure of pride that I stride into the offices of Faber Shipping Worldwide. Long may it prosper.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Chapter 2</b></p><p>After I give an affectionate wave of greeting to Miss Chloe Cantrell, who sits at the reception desk poring over invoices and accounts, she shows me into the office of Ezra Pickering, Clerk of Faber Shipping Worldwide.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;So good to see you back, Jacky,&#x201d; says he, rising from his desk and holding out his hand. &#x201c;I hope you had a pleasant journey.&#x201d; He is, of course, impeccably dressed and groomed, as well he should be, being a prosperous young attorney&#x2014;made prosperous, in large part, because of the primarily legal business doings of Faber Shipping.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Most pleasant, thank you, Ezra,&#x201d; I say, taking his hand and a chair. As usual after a cruise, I pass over to him my ship&#x2019;s log and any diplomatic pouches I might have been handed by foreign embassies. There is only one this time. From Havana.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He takes his own chair, and we begin our meeting.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;I perceive that you have been rather restless of late, Jacky. You have taken three trips to the southern waters,&#x201d; he says, picking up a sheaf of papers, &#x201c;since&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Since I was bound to the courthouse whipping post, my back bared, and administered twelve strokes of the rod for the joy of the mob? And you wonder why I prefer the sea to the land?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Well, I believe that situation could have gone much worse.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I reserve judgment on that with a solid <i>humph.</i><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;I hope that Amy Trevelyne is well?&#x201d; I ask, with raised eyebrow. Ezra has been well-mannered in pursuit of the shy Miss Trevelyne for some time now, but she has proved elusive, saying only, &#x201c;I am not yet ready for that sort of thing.&#x201d; She has forgiven me for some depredations against propriety and common sense on my part, and she is once again my dearest friend, in spite of the differences in our temperaments. I greatly enjoy my stays with her at dear oldDovecote between voyages.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Yes, she is well,&#x201d; he says, and gives me his little half smile. &#x201c;And she avidly looks forward to your next visit.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we get down to business in earnest.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Ahem. Revenues are up. The fishing fleet is doing well, as are the Emerald Playhouse and the Pig and Whistle Inn. We were able to sell the cargoes of your last two cruises and expect no difficulty with this latest one. We must keep the rum distilleries supplied with ample molasses, mustn&#x2019;t we? Your fire brigade, the Shamrock Hose, Ladder, and Pump Company, under the able direction of Arthur McBride, are dashing about putting out fires and signing up new insurance subscribers every day. He has become quite the local hero.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Hardly surprising,&#x201d; I murmur.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;And, since Pigger O&#x2019;Toole&#x2019;s gang of scofflaws has been cleared out of Skivareen&#x2019;s, all outstanding indentures for passage on the <i>Lorelei Lee</i> are now paid up, thanks largely to the fists of John Thomas and Smasher McGee.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Good lads.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;And the <i>Lee</i> herself is due in with another load of passengers.

Between 1827 and 1831, he published three volumes of poetry: <i>Tamerlane</i> (1827), <i>Al Aaraaf</i> (1829), and <i>Poems</i> (1831). From 1831 to 1835, he lived in Baltimore, where he began a lifelong struggle with poverty, disappointments in love, and addiction to alcohol. This last defect made it impossible for him to retain the editorial positions he later secured on magazines in Richmond, Philadelphia, and New York, despite the fact that the tales and book reviews he contributed greatly increased circulation. In May 1836, he married Virginia Clemm, a child of thirteen and the daughter of a paternal aunt. In April 1844, he moved his family to New York, and in January of the following year his literary fortunes turned when his poem &#x201c;The Raven&#x201d; appeared in the <i>New York Evening News</i>. Overnight, he became the most talked-about man of letters in America. Early in 1847 his wife died, and the year 1848 saw the end of two unhappy love affairs. He died on October 7, 1849.<br>&nbsp;<br><b>Stephen Marlowe</b> (1928&#x2013;2008) was the author of more than fifty novels, including the internationally acclaimed <i>Memoirs of Christopher Columbus</i>, which was awarded the French Prix Gutenberg du Livre in 1988, and in 1997, he received a lifetime achievement award from the Private Eye Writers of America.

Kent and Nina Berberova.<br><br>"Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way."&nbsp;&nbsp;So begins <b>Anna Karenina</b>, Leo Tolstoy's great modern novel of an adulterous affair set against the backdrop of Moscow and St. Petersburg high society in the later half of the nineteenth century.&nbsp;&nbsp;A sophisticated woman who is respectably married to a government bureaucrat, Anna begins a passionate, all-consuming involvement with a rich army officer.&nbsp;&nbsp;Refusing to conduct a discreet affair, she scandalizes society by abandoning both her husband and her young son for Count Vronsky--with tragic consequences.&nbsp;&nbsp;Running parallel is the story of the courtship and marriage of Konstantin Levin (the melancholy nobleman who is Tolstoy's stand-in) and Princess Kitty Shcherbatsky.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Levin's spiritual searching and growth reflect the religious ideals that at the time Tolstoy was evolving for himself.&nbsp;&nbsp;Taken together, the two plots embroider a vast canvas that ultimately encompasses all levels of Russian society.&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now and then Tolstoy's novel writes its own self, is produced by its matter, but its subject," noted Vladimir Nabokov.&nbsp;&nbsp;"<b>Anna Karenina</b> is one of the greatest love stories in world literature."&nbsp;&nbsp;As Matthew Arnold wrote in his celebrated essay on Tolstoy:&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are not to take <b>Anna Karenina</b> as a work of art; we are to take it as a piece of life."&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tolstoy is the greatest Russian writer of prose fiction....Tolstoy's prose keeps pace with our pulses, his characters seem to move with the same swing as the people passing under our window while we sit reading his book....No wonder, then, that elderly Russians at their evening tea talk of Tolstoy's characters as of people who really exist, people to whom their friends may be likened, people they see as distinctly as if they had danced with Kitty and Anna at that ball or dined with Oblonsky at his favorite restaurant, as we shall soon be dining with him. Readers call Tolstoy a giant not because other writers are dwarfs but because he remains always of exactly our own stature, exactly keeping pace with us instead of passing by in the distance, as other authors do." <br><br>--Vladimir Nabokov</p><h2>A Sportsman&#39;s Notebook (Everyman&#39;s Library Classics)</h2><p>Millennium Project edition, library stamps and marks, shelf wear to dust jacket, page edges tanned.

After the family had moved to Moscow in 1827 he entered Petersburg University where he studied philosophy. When he was nineteen he published his first poems and, convinced that Europe contained the source of real knowledge, went to the University of Berlin. After two years he returned to Russia and took his degree at the University of Moscow. In 1843 he fell in love with Pauline Garcia-Viardot, a young Spanish singer, who influenced the rest of his life; he followed her on her singing tours in Europe and spent long periods in the French house of herself and her husband, both of whom accepted him as a family friend. He sent his daughter by a sempstress to be brought up among the Viardot children. After 1856 he lived mostly abroad, and he became the first Russian writer to gain a wide reputation in Europe; he was a well-known figure in Parisian literary circles, where his friends included Flaubert and the Goncourt brothers, and an honorary degree was conferred on him at Oxford. His series of six novels reflect a period of Russian life from 1830s to the 1870s: they are&nbsp;<i>Rudin</i>&nbsp;(1855),&nbsp;<i>A House of Gentlefolk</i>&nbsp;(1858),&nbsp;<i>On the Eve</i>&nbsp;(1859; a Penguin Classic),&nbsp;<i>Fathers and Sons</i>&nbsp;(1861),&nbsp;<i>Smoke</i>&nbsp;(1867) and&nbsp;<i>Virgin Soi</i><b>l</b>&nbsp;(1876). He also wrote plays, which include the comedy&nbsp;<i>A Month in the Country</i>; short stories and&nbsp;<i>Sketches from a Hunter&#x2019;s Album</i>&nbsp;(a Penguin Classic); and literary essays and memoirs. He died in Paris in 1883 after being ill for a year, and was buried in Russia.</p><h2>The Wind Off the Small Isles and The Lost One</h2><p><p><b>The</b><b> sweeping long-lost novella, now available in paperback for the first time in 40 years, alongside </b><b>recently rediscovered short story 'The Lost One', from the original queen of romantic suspense</b><b></b><b> </b></p><p><b><i>'Total heaven' Harriet Evans</i></b><b></b><b> </b></p><p>1879.

She was born in Sunderland, County Durham in 1916, but lived for most of her life in Scotland, a source of much inspiration for her writing. Her first novel, <i>Madam, Will You Talk?</i> was published in 1955 and marked the beginning of a long and acclaimed writing career. In 1971 she was awarded the International PEN Association's Frederick Niven Prize for <i>The Crystal Cave</i>, and in 1974 the Scottish Arts Council Award for one of her children's books, <i>Ludo and the Star Horse</i>. She was married to the Scottish geologist Frederick Stewart, and died in 2014.</p><h2>The Death of Ivan Ilych And Other Stories</h2><p><p>Leo Tolstoy combined detailed physical description with perceptive psychological insight to sweep aside the sham of surface appearances and lay bare man's intimate gestures, acts, and thoughts. Murder and sacrifice...greed and devotion...lust and affection...vanity and love -- one by one, in this volume of great stories, Tolstoy dissects the basic drives, emotions, and motives of ordinary people searching for self-knowledge and spiritual perfection. Chekhov said, "Of authors my favorite is Tolstoy." And Turgenev "marveled at the strength of his huge talent...It sends a cold shudder even down my back...He is a master, a master."</p></p><p><b>Amazon Best Books of the Month, December 2009</b>: To anyone for whom Leo Tolstoy's masterpieces <i>War and Peace</i> and <i>Anna Karenina</i> have stood as giants too daunting to scale, and equally to the many readers who have devoured those novels and are hungry for more, we offer <i>The Death of Ivan Ilyich and Other Stories</i>. Newly translated by the team of Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky, who have enlivened the Russian classics for a new generation, this selection of 11 of his finest stories reveals a Tolstoy of many sides and unsurpassed storytelling talents. Along with smaller gems like "Alyosha the Pot," the collection features a handful of thrilling longer tales that each carry the power of a novel: the terrifying murderer's confession of "The Kreuzer Sonata," the breathlessly dramatic path of a single crime through dozens of lives in "The Forged Coupon," and the haunting account of the isolation of mortality in the legendary title story. Most revelatory of all for a modern reader is the final novella, and Tolstoy's final work, "Hadji Murat," the disturbingly contemporary story of a fiercely honorable Chechen warrior caught between local rivalries and the ambivalent reach of a decadent empire. <i>--Tom Nissley</i>Count Leo Tolstoy was born on September 9, 1828, in Yasnaya Polyana, Russia. Orphaned at nine, he was brought up by an elderly aunt and educated by French tutors until he matriculated at Kazan University in 1844. In 1847, he gave up his studies and, after several aimless years, volunteered for military duty in the army, serving as a junior officer in the Crimean War before retiring in 1857. In 1862, Tolstoy married Sophie Behrs, a marriage that was to become, for him, bitterly unhappy. His diary, started in 1847, was used for self-study and self-criticism; it served as the source from which he drew much of the material that appeared not only in his great novels <b>War and Peace</b> (1869) and <b>Anna Karenina</b> (1877), but also in his shorter works. Seeking religious justification for his life, Tolstoy evolved a new Christianity based upon his own interpretation of the Gospels. Yasnaya Polyana became a mecca for his many converts At the age of eighty-two, while away from home, the writer suffered a break down in his health in Astapovo, Riazan, and he died there on November 20, 1910. <br><p>Hugh McLean has published widely on Russian literature.</p></p><h2>Tintin: Cigars of the Pharaoh</h2><p>On the hunt for an Egyptologist and a mysterious ancient pharaoh, Tintin scours Egypt and India. He makes friends with elephants, narrowly avoids falling victim to the poison of madness and saves a maharajah from a killer tiger.</p><p><i>Cigars of the Pharaoh</i> is one of Tintin's earliest adventures. He and Snowy are on a cruise to Egypt when they happen to meet Professor Sophocles Sarcophagus (the first of Tintin's absent-minded professors) and join his expedition. But they become embroiled in a complicated scheme involving a fakir, cigars marked with an unusual brand, and Rajijah, the poison of madness. Most significantly, Tintin meets the detectives Thompson and Thomson as well as the movie mogul Rastapopolous. While <i>Cigars of the Pharaoh</i> is a self-contained story, some of the mysteries are resolved in <i>The Blue Lotus</i>. Herge wrote <i>Cigars</i> in 1932 then revised it in 1955, which is why the art has the more polished look of later stories as well as the anachronistic glimpse of a copy of <i>Destination: Moon</i>. <i>--David Horiuchi</i>The Adventures of TinTin - Comic book format</p><h2>A Friendly Introduction to Number Theory (2nd Edition)</h2><p>This introductory text is designed to entice non-math focused individuals into learning some mathematics, while teaching them to think mathematically.

For the early church fathers the prophecy of Isaiah was not a compendium of Jewish history or theology but an announcement of the coming Messiah fulfilled in the life and ministry of Jesus of Nazareth. As such, the prophet's words were a rich source of theological reflection concerning their Lord and a vital aid in their defense against the objections of the Jews that Jesus was the promised Messiah. The interpretation of Jesus' ministry in light of Isaiah's prophecy was not a theological innovation on their part, but rather a following of the path blazed by the New Testament writers and Jesus himself. Among passage-by-passage commentaries cited here are those by Eusebius of Caesarea, Jerome, Cyril of Alexandria and Theodoret of Cyr, as well as one attributed to Basil of Caesarea. John Chrysostom preached a series of homilies on Isaiah of which most of those extant concern the first eight chapters, though Chrysostom frequently cites Isaiah in numerous homilies on other books. Augustine of Hippo, Gregory the Great and Bede the Venerable frequently cited passages from Isaiah 1&#x2015;39 as did many other fathers in defending the Christian faith from Jewish critics. Edited by Steven A. McKinion, this volume of the Ancient Christian Commentary on Scripture offers readers access to materials ranging from East to West and from the first through the eighth centuries, some appearing in English translation for the first time. Within this treasure house are riches to illumine the mind and fire the heart.</p><p>McKinion is associate professor of historical theology at Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary in Wake Forest, North Carolina. He is also the author of <em>Life and Practice in the Early Church: A Documentary Reader</em> and <em>Words, Imagery and the Mystery of Christ: A Reconstruction of Cyril of Alexandria's Christology.</em>"This volume continues the valuable exploration of patristic interpretation." (Mark Bilby, Religious Studies Review, September 2009)<br><br>"A 'must' for all theological libraries." (International Review of Biblical Studies, Vol. 55, 2008-2009)<br><br>"A wealth of information for the classic Bible scholar." (Ravonne A. Green, American Reference Books Annual, 2006, Volume 37)<br><br>"Contemporary Christians would do well to draw the hermeneutical circle broadly enough to include not only cross-cultural voices from around the world but also the voices to be found in the Ancient Christian Commentary series. This is an excellent sermon-preparation resource for pastors." (Christian Century, May 2, 2006)<br><br>"All who are interested in the interpretation of the Bible will welcome the forthcoming multivolume series Ancient Christian Commentary on Scripture. Here the insights of scores of early church fathers will be assembled and made readily available for significant passages throughout the Bible and the Apocrypha. It is hard to think of a more worthy ecumenical project to be undertaken by InterVarsity Press." (Bruce M. Metzger, professor emeritus of New Testament, Princeton Theological Seminary)<br><br>"For those who think that church history began around 1941, when their pastor was born, this commentary will be a great surprise. Christians throughout the centuries have read the biblical text and nursed their spirits with it and then applied it to their lives. These commentaries reflect that the witness of the Holy Spirit was present in his church throughout the centuries. As a result, we can profit by allowing the ancient Christians to speak to us today." (Haddon Robinson, Harold John Ockenga Distinguished Professor of Preaching, Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary)<br><br>"There is no shortage of new books on the market and it may be a surprise to some to see IVP producing the Ancient Christian Commentary on Scripture series. But, bearing in mind C. S. Lewis's admonition, 'It is a good rule, after reading a new book, never to allow yourself another new one till you have read an old one in between,' this series will fill a great need that many of us may not even be aware of--the need to read those who have gone before us." (D. Stuart Briscoe)<br><br>"We speak abstractly in scholarly circles of the need to transcend looking at Christianity through the spectrum of modern presuppositions. This series, based on the commentaries of early Christians, gives us a concrete way to do this. It's a great idea." (Don S. Browning, Alexander Campbell Professor of Ethics and Social Sciences, The Divinity School, University of Chicago)<br><br>"The Scriptures have been read with love and attention for nearly two thousand years, and listening to the voice of believers from previous centuries opens us to unexpected insight and deepened faith. Those who studied Scripture in the centuries closest to its writing, the centuries during and following persecution and martyrdom, speak with particular authority. The Ancient Christian Commentary on Scripture will bring to life the truth that we are invisibly surrounded by a great cloud of witnesses." (Frederica Mathewes-Green, commentator, National Public Radio)<br><br>"Composed in the style of the great medieval <em>catenae,</em> this new anthology of patristic commentary on Holy Scripture, conveniently arranged by chapter and verse, will be a valuable resource for prayer, study and proclamation. By calling attention to the rich Christian heritage preceding the separations between East and West and between Protestant and Catholic, this series will perform a major service to the cause of ecumenism."

McGinley Professor of Religion and Society, Fordham University)</p><h2>Dracula (Barnes &amp; Noble Signature Edition)</h2><p>Handsomely produced in hardcover at a very affordable price, Barnes &amp; Noble Signature Editions have been carefully edited and reset in a modern design for greater readability. Each volume includes an introduction, informative notes and a chronology of the writer's life and times to enable the reader to gain a deeper understanding of these enduring works.</p><p><i>Dracula</i> is one of the few horror books to be honored by inclusion in the Norton Critical Edition series. (The others are <i>Frankenstein,</i> <i>The Turn of the Screw,</i> <i>Heart of Darkness,</i> <i>The Picture of Dorian Gray,</i> and <i>The Metamorphosis.</i>) This 100th-anniversary edition includes not only the complete authoritative text of the novel with illuminating footnotes, but also four contextual essays, five reviews from the time of publication, five articles on dramatic and film variations, and seven selections from literary and academic criticism. Nina Auerbach of the University of Pennsylvania (author of <i>Our Vampires, Ourselves</i>) and horror scholar David J. Skal (author of <i>Hollywood Gothic</i>, <i>The Monster Show</i>, and <i>Screams of Reason</i>) are the editors of the volume. Especially fascinating are excerpts from materials that Bram Stoker consulted in his research for the book, and his working papers over the several years he was composing it. The selection of criticism includes essays on how <i>Dracula</i> deals with female sexuality, gender inversion, homoerotic elements, and Victorian fears of "reverse colonization" by politically turbulent Transylvania.While serving as actor Henry Irving&#39;s business manager at the Lyceum Theatre in London, Bram Stoker (1847-1912) also pursued his literary interests. In this Gothic horror novel of 1897, which brought him international fame, he presents the chilling vampire Count Dracula, modelled in part on Irving&#39;s powerful personality.</p><h2>MR. WILSON&#39;S CABINET OF WONDER: Pronged Ants, Horned Humans, Mice on Toast, and Other Marvels of Jurassic Techno logy</h2><p>Writing with great style and humor, Weschler guides the readers through the Museum of Jurassic Technology and through the mind of its curator, David Wilson, a man of unusual imagination who mounts exhibits such as spore-inhaling ants, bats deploying ultraviolet frequencies, peach-pit carvings, and other exhibits that seem the manifest definition of bizarre. Illustrations.</p><p>In the non-Aristotelian, non-Euclidean, non-Newtonian space between the walls of the Museum of Jurassic Technology in Los Angeles exist bats that can fly through lead barriers, spore-ingesting pronged ants, elaborate theories of memory, and a host of other off-kilter scientific oddities that challenge the traditional notions of truth and fiction. Lawrence Weschler's book, expanded from an article for <i>Harper's</i>, is, at turns, a tour of the museum, a profile of its founder and curator, David Wilson, and a meditation on the role of imagination and authority in <i>all</i> museums, in science and in life. <i>Mr. Wilson's Cabinet of Wonder</i> is an exquisite piece of "magic realist nonfiction" that will prove utterly captivating.<b>Lawrence Weschler&nbsp;</b>was for over twenty years (1981-2002) a staff writer at&nbsp;<i>The New Yorker</i>, where his work shuttled between political tragedies and cultural comedies.&nbsp; He is a two-time winner of the George Polk Award and was also a recipient of Lannan Literary Award. his nonfiction book&nbsp;<i>Mr. Wilson's Cabinet of Wonder</i>&nbsp;was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize and National Book Critics Circle Award.</p><h2>The End of Days: Armageddon and Prophecies of the Return (The Earth Chronicles)</h2><p><p>Why is it that our current twenty-first century a.d. is so similar to the twenty-first century B.C.? At a time when religious fanaticism and a clash of civilizations raise the specter of a nuclear Armageddon, many ask: Is history destined to repeat itself? What does the future hold? Will biblical prophecies come true, and if so, when?</p><p>Ever since Zecharia Sitchin, in his first trailblazing book <em>The 12th Planet</em>, brought to life the Sumerian civilization and its record of the Annunaki&#x2014;the extraterrestrials who had come to Earth from their planet Nibiru, fashioned mankind, and gave us civilization and religion&#x2014;questions have abounded. Are the ancient gods still here, or did they leave? Will they return? What will happen then? Will there be another Deluge or Apocalypse when Nibiru meets Earth? What about &#x201c;Planet X&#x201d; and the Mayan 2012? What about Jesus?</p><p>In <em>The End of Days</em>, a masterwork that required thirty years of additional research, Sitchin dares to give the answers by presenting compelling new evidence that the Past is the Future&#x2014;that mankind and its planet Earth are subject to a predetermined cyclical Celestial Time.</p><p>Tracing historical events from the messianic fervor and use of nuclear weapons in the twenty-first century B.C., Sitchin resolves ancient enigmas like the Nazca Lines or the origin and significance of the Cross, the Fishes, and the Chalice, places in context the events of the Last Supper and hidden clues like those in Da Vinci's painting, explains the space-related reasons for the everlasting centrality of Jerusalem, and&#x2014;following in the footsteps of Sir Isaac Newton&#x2014;deciphers the Time Code in the books of Daniel and Revelation and of the Day of the Lord and the End of Days prophecies.</p><p>In this remarkable and relevant conclusion to his bestselling <em>The Earth Chronicles</em> series, Sitchin shatters perceptions and uses history to reveal what is to come at The End of Days.</p></p><p><p>Zecharia Sitchin is an internationally acclaimed author and researcher whose books offer evidence that we are not alone in our own solar system. One of a handful of scholars able to read the Sumerian cuneiform tablets, he has combined archaeology, ancient texts, and the Bible with the latest scientific discoveries to retell the history and prehistory of mankind and planet Earth. His trailblazing books have been translated into more than twenty languages; his first one, an oft-quoted classic, celebrates the thirtieth anniversary of its publication. A graduate of the University of London and a journalist and editor in Israel for many years, he now lives and writes in New York.</p>Lots of people have been waiting for this book for a long time. Thirty years ago, Sitchin began writing the Earth Chronicle series, which posits the theory (supposedly recorded in Sumerian myth) that extraterrestrials, the Aununnaki, arrived on Earth eons ago and genetically engineered humans. Much of this book is taken up with backstory, but that doesn't mean newbies can just jump in. Although Sitchin helpfully highlights key points in boldface, there's a lot to keep straight here. Readers attempting to deal with a couple hundred thousand years of history, ancient astronauts becoming human gods, and Sitchin's attempt to tie it all into biblical prophecies may wish they were on another planet. Yet the series has legions of devoted fans who have been waiting to learn if the Aununnaki are coming back and, if so, when. Sitchin notes that it's hard to determine where to start the countdown to the end days, which may be tied to the Aununnaki's reappearance. It might come in 2012. Too soon? How about 2087? Taking the long view? Try 2240. There's more, a lot more, but we won't risk a spoiler. <i>Ilene Cooper</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

When pressed to paper, its perfection is dramatically captured and revealed-as a work of nature, but with a kinship to art. <p>"The Pressed Plant" is the fist book to demonstrate this aesthetic phenomenon through hundreds of stunning illustrations that date from the eighteenth to the twentieth century, most of which have never before been published. </p><p>Part one, The Plant Collected, shows real plants of astonishing beauty that have been collected, pressed, and mounted by botanists or by amateurs, as single sheets or bound into books called herbaria. The anecdotal text relates the intriguing and romantic story of plant collections as a hazardous natural science in uncharted territories, as a genteel Victorian pastime, and as the serious pursuit of a remarkable group of nineteenth-century women botanists. </p><p>Part Two, The Plant's Impression, shows and describes rare and classic examples of both nature prints, in which the plant is inked, pressed, and printed, and sun pictures, produced when a plant is placed on light-sensitive paper and exposed to the sun. An Afterward looks at how botanical materials are used in unusual works by leading contemporary artists, while detailed appendices describe methods of botanical specimen collecting and mounting, materials and suppliers, and botanical institutions and museums worldwide. </p><p>"The Pressed Plant" presents a fascinating view of the natural world, beautifully preserved.</p>Andrea DiNoto is a well-known writer on design and collecting.

He remembered the first time he had run up this hillside, half a kiloday ago, after his original encounter with the formidable Tak-Saleed.<br>Formidable? Afsan clicked his teeth in humor, figuring that the choice of adjective was a sign that he must be getting accustomed to all this. Back then, after his introduction to the master astrologer, the word he'd used was "monstrous."<br>That first time he'd run up here his only thought had been to get out of the city, get back to his distant home Pack of Carno, back to the simple life of a country boy. He was sure he'd never get used to this dizzying, terrifying world of apprenticeship, of scowling imperial guards, of hundreds of people--ten or more gathered together in the same place at once! Afsan hadn't experienced crowds like that before, never felt such a wash of pheromones over him. He couldn't stand the tension, the constant fear that he was encroaching on another's territory or otherwise breaching protocol. He had found himself tipping from the waist so often it made his head spin.<br>But on that day, as on this, Afsan had been calmed by the magnificent view from here, tension slipping from his body, claws retracting so far that Afsan thought he'd never see them again, tail swishing back and forth in leisurely, contented movements.<br>The sun had set a short time ago. It had swollen to a bloated egg, changing from its normal white to a deep violet, before dropping behind the ragged cones of the Ch'mar volcanoes to the west of the city. A beautiful sunset, Afsan had thought, the wispy clouds a veil across the dimming disk, tinged with purple, with red, with deepest blue. But then Afsan found all sunsets beautiful, and not just because of the play of color across the clouds, although this evening that was indeed spectacular. No, Afsan welcomed sunsets because he preferred the night, craved the stars.<br>This will be a grand night for observing, he thought. The only clouds were around the volcanoes, and those rarely lifted. Overhead, the vast dome of the sky was immaculate.<br>Tonight was odd-night. Most adults slept on odd-nights. For that very reason, Afsan did not. He preferred the peace and tranquillity of the hillsides on those nights when--the thought came unbidden--it was as if they were his own territory.<br>Of course, Afsan owned nothing of value, and, having entered a life of quiet study, his chances of acquiring land were--how did the old joke go?--about as likely as one of the Empress's eggs being used as a game ball.<br>But even if he couldn't own land, he would always have the stars. The sky was darkening quickly, as it always did, and there would only be a short time of real night before even-day broke.<br>Afsan inhaled deeply. The air was as clear as the waters of spring-fed Lake Doognar back home, the smells of--he flexed his nostrils, wrinkled his muzzle--of wildflowers; the scent of a large animal, perhaps an armorback (although how one of those would get this high up a mountain he didn't know); urine on those rocks, likely from a much smaller critter; and, underneath it all, faint, but more prominent than when he'd first arrived in Capital City, the sulfurous tinge of volcanic gases.<br>He had been straddling a boulder, his tail hanging over it, to watch the sun go down. Now it was time to climb higher up the hillside. He did so, the three broad toes on each foot giving him excellent traction. Upon reaching the crest, he clicked his teeth in satisfaction, then continued partway down the other side, placing the bulk of the hill between himself and the torch-lit glow of Capital City. Afsan lowered himself to the ground, and lay on his side to look up at the panorama of the night sky.<br>As usual, Afsan found it uncomfortable with all his weight on his right shoulder and hip, but what alternative was there? Once he had tried lying on his belly in the sleeping position and had craned his neck to look up instead of forward, but that had given him a stinging crick.<br>Dekadays ago, he'd asked Tak-Saleed why there was no easy posture for Quintaglios to look at the stars, why their muscular tails made it impossible to lie on their backs. Saleed had stared down at young Afsan and declared that God had wished it that way, that She had made the stars for Her face alone to gaze upon, not for the pinched muzzles of overly curious apprentices.<br>Afsan slapped his tail sideways against the soil, irritated by the memory. He drew his nictitating membranes over his eyes. The purple glow of the twilight still filtered through, but that was all. Afsan cleared his mind of all thoughts of old Saleed, opened the membranes, and drank in the beauty he had come here to enjoy.<br>The stars scurried from upriver to downriver as the brief night raced by. Two of the moons were prominent at the start of the evening: Slowpoke and the Big One. The Big One was showing only a crescent sliver of illumination, although the rest of its disk could be seen as a round blackness, obscuring the stars. Afsan held his arm out and found that if he unsheathed his thumbclaw, its sickle silhouette appeared about the same height and shape as the Big One. The Big One's orange face was always intriguing--there were markings on it, details just a little too small, just a little too dim, to be clearly made out. What it was, Afsan couldn't say. It seemed <i>rocky</i>, but how could a rock fly through the sky?<br>He turned his attention to Slowpoke. It had been in one of its recalcitrant moods again these past few nights, fighting its way upriver instead of sailing downriver. Oh, the other moons would do that occasionally, too, but never with the determination of tiny Slowpoke. Slowpoke was Afsan's favorite.<br>Someday he would make a study of the moons. He'd read much of what had been written about them, including Saleed's three-volume <i>Dancing the Night Away</i>. Such a whimsical title! How unlike the Saleed he knew, the Saleed he feared.<br>Some of the moons moved quickly across the sky, others took several tens of nights to cross from horizon to horizon. All went through phases, waxing and waning between the extremes of showing a fully lit circular shape and appearing as simply a black circle covering the stars. What did it all mean? Afsan exhaled noisily.<br>He scanned the sky along the ecliptic, that path along which the sun traveled each day. Two planets were visible, bright Kevpel and ruddy Davpel. Planets were similar to the moons, in that they moved against the background stars, but they appeared as tiny pinpoints, revealing no face or details, and their progress against the firmament had to be measured over days or dekadays. A few of the six known planets also showed the strange retrograde motions that some of the moons exhibited, although it took kilodays for them to complete these maneuvers.<br>Near the zenith now was the constellation of the Prophet. Afsan had seen old hand-copied books that called this constellation the Hunter, after Lubal, largest of the Five Original Hunters, but as worship of them was now all but banned, the official name had been changed to honor Larsk, the first to gaze upon the Face of God.<br>Lubal or Larsk, the picture was the same: Points of light marked the shoulders, hips, elbows, knees, and the tip of the long tail. Two bright stars represented the eyes. It was like a reverse image, Afsan thought--the kind one gets after staring at an object, then looking at a white surface--since the prophet's eyes and Lubal's, too, like those of all Quintaglios, must have been obsidian black.<br>Above the Prophet, glowing faintly across the length of the sky, ran the powdery reflection of the great River that Land sailed on in its never-ending journey toward the Face of God. At least, that was what old Saleed said the dusty pathway of light crossing the night was, but he'd never been able to explain to Afsan's satisfaction why it was only during certain times that the great River cast a reflection on the sky.<br>Saleed! Abominable Saleed! It had taken Afsan fifty-five days riding atop a domesticated hornface in one of the merchant caravans to get from Pack Carno, part of the province of Arj'toolar, deep within Land's interior, to Capital City on the upriver shore of Land.<br>The children were the children of the Pack, of course--only the creche operators knew who Afsan's actual parents might have been--and the whole Pack was proud that one of their own had been selected to apprentice to the court astrologer. The choice, presumably, had been made based on Afsan's showing in the most recent battery of vocational exams. He had felt honored as he packed his sashes and boots, his books and astrolabe, and set out for his selected future. But he had been here for almost five hundred days now. True, that was something of a record. As he had discovered after arriving here, Saleed had had six other apprentices in the last four kilodays, all of whom had been dismissed. But, even though he seemed to have greater endurance than the previous tryouts, Afsan's dream of contributing to the advancement of astrological research had been smashed by his master.<br>Afsan had idolized Saleed, devouring his books on portents and omens, his treatise on the reflected River in the sky, his articles on the significance of each constellation. How he had looked forward to meeting the great one! How disappointed he had been when that day finally came. Soon, though, Afsan would be leaving on his pilgrimage. He thanked God for that, for he'd be away from his master for a great many days--able to study in private, free from Saleed's critical scowl.<br>Afsan shook his head slightly, again clearing his thoughts. He'd come here to bask in the beauty of the night, not to wallow in his own misfortune. One day the stars would yield their secrets to him.<br>Time slipped by unnoticed as Afsan drank in the glory overhead. Moons careened across the sky, waxing and waning as they went. The stars rose and fell, constellations hustling across the firmament. Meteors flashed through the night, tiny streaks of gold against the black. Nothing gave Afsan more pleasure than ...</p><h2>Charlotte&#39;s Web Collector&#39;s Edition</h2><p><p> Beloved by generations, <i>Charlotte's Web</i> and <i>Stuart Little</i> are two of the most cherished stories of all time.

As her legion of fans can attest, she strikes the perfect balance between excitement and insight, action and heart. Now, in this breathless new novel, Garwood has written her most electrifying thriller to date.<br><br><b>KILLJOY<br><br></b>Avery Delaney has always tried to put the past far behind her. Abandoned by her rapacious, conniving mother when she was only three days old, Avery was raised by her grandmother and beloved aunt Carolyn. Then, when she was eleven, she witnessed her grandmother&#x2019;s violent death, before Avery herself was shot and left for dead. Miraculously she survived.

There are more than thirty million copies of her books in print.The wait was making Avery crazy. She sat in her little square cubicle, her back against the wall, one leg crossed over the other, drumming her fingertips against the desktop with one hand and holding an icepack against her wounded knee with the other. What was taking so long? Why hadn't Andrews called? She stared hard at the phone, willing it to ring. Nothing. Not a sound. Turning in her swivel chair, she checked the digital clock for the hundredth time. It was now 10:05, same as it was ten seconds ago. For Pete's sake, she should have heard something by now.<br><br>Mel Gibson stood up and leaned over the partition separating his workspace from Avery's and gave her a sympathetic look. That was his honest-to-goodness, real name, but Mel thought it was holding him back because no one in the law enforcement agency would ever take him seriously. Yet, he refused to have it legally changed to "Brad Pitt," as his supportive coworkers had suggested.<br><br>"Hi, Brad," Avery said. She and the others were still trying out the new name to see if it fit. Last week it was "George Clooney," and that name got about the same reaction "Brad" was getting now, a glare and a reminder that his name wasn't "George," it wasn't "Brad," and it wasn't "Mel." It was "Melvin."<br><br>"You probably should have heard by now," he said.<br><br>She refused to let him rile her. Tall, geeky-looking, with an extremely prominent Adam's apple, Mel had the annoying habit of using his third finger to push his thick wire-rimmed glasses back up on his ski nose. Margo, another coworker, told Avery that Mel did it on purpose. It was his way of letting the other three know how superior he felt he was.<br><br>Avery disagreed. Mel wouldn't do anything improper. He lived by a code of ethics he believed personified the FBI. He was dedicated, responsible, hardworking, ambitious, and he dressed for the job he wanted . . . with one little glitch. Although he was only twenty-seven years old, his clothing resembled the attire agents wore back in the fifties. Black suits, white long-sleeved shirts with button-down collars, skinny black ties, black wingtip shoes with a perfect shine, and a crew cut she knew he got trimmed once every two weeks.<br><br>For all of his strange habits--he could quote any line from The FBI Story, starring Jimmy Stewart--he had an incredibly sharp mind and was the ultimate team player. He just needed to lighten up a bit. That was all.<br><br>"I mean, don't you think you should have heard by now?" He sounded as worried as she felt.<br><br>"It's still early." Then, less than five seconds later, she said, "You're right. We should have heard by now."<br><br>"No," he corrected. "I said that you should have heard. Lou and Margo and I didn't have anything to do with your decision to call in the SWAT team."<br><br>Oh, God, what had she been thinking? "In other words, you don't want to take the flak if I'm wrong?"<br><br>"Not flak," he said. "The fall. I need this job. It's the closest I'm going to get to being an agent. With my eyesight . . ."<br><br>"I know, Mel."<br><br>"Melvin," he automatically corrected. "And the benefits are great."<br><br>Margo stood so she could join the conversation. "The pay sucks, though."<br><br>Mel shrugged. "So does the work environment," he said. "But still . . . it's the FBI."<br><br>"What's wrong with our work environment?" Lou asked as he too stood. His workstation was on Avery's left. Mel's was directly in front of hers, and Margo's cubicle was adjacent to Lou's. The pen--as they lovingly called their hellhole office space--was located behind the mechanical room with its noisy water heaters and compressors. "I mean, really, what's wrong with it?" he asked again, sounding bewildered.<br><br>Lou was as clueless as ever, but also endearing, Avery thought. Whenever she looked at him, she was reminded of Pig-Pen in the old Peanuts cartoon. Lou always looked disheveled. He was absolutely brilliant, yet he couldn't seem to find his mouth when he was eating, and his short-sleeved shirt usually had at least one stain. This morning there were two. One was jelly from the raspberry-filled doughnuts Margo had brought in. The big red spot was just above the black ink stain from the cartridge pen in his white shirt pocket.<br><br>Lou tucked in his shirttail for the third time that morning and said, "I like being down here. It's cozy."<br><br>"We work in the corner of the basement without any windows," Margo pointed out.<br><br>"So what?" Lou asked. "Where we work doesn't make us any less important. We're all part of a team."<br><br>"I'd like to be a part of the team that has windows," Margo said.<br><br>"Can't have everything. Say, Avery, how's the knee?" he asked, suddenly changing subjects.<br><br>She gingerly lifted the icepack and surveyed the damage. "The swelling's gone down."<br><br>"How'd it happen?" Mel asked. He was the only one who hadn't heard the grisly details.<br><br>Margo ran her fingers through her short dark curls and said, "An old lady nearly killed her."<br><br>"With her Cadillac," Lou said. "It happened in her parking garage. The woman obviously didn't see her. There really ought to be an age restriction on renewing a driver's license."<br><br>"Did she hit you?" Mel asked.<br><br>"No," Avery answered. "I dove to get out of her way when she came roaring around the corner. I ended up flying across the hood of a Mercedes and whacked my knee on the hood ornament. I recognized the Cadillac. It belongs to Mrs. Speigel, who lives in my building. I think she's about ninety. She's not supposed to drive anymore, but every once in a while I'll see her taking the car out to do errands."<br><br>"Did she stop?" Mel asked.<br><br>She shook her head. "I don't think she had a clue I was there. She was accelerating so fast I was just glad there weren't any other people in her way."<br><br>"You're right, Lou," Margo said. She disappeared behind her cubicle wall, bent down to push the box of copy paper into the corner, and then stood on top of it. She was suddenly as tall as Mel. "There should be an age limit on keeping a license. Avery told us the woman was so little she couldn't see her head over the back of the seat. Just a puff of gray hair."<br><br>"Our bodies shrink as we age," Mel said. "Just think, Margo. When you're ninety, no one will be able to see you."<br><br>Margo, a petite five feet two inches, wasn't offended. "I'll just wear higher heels."<br><br>The phone rang, interrupting the conversation. Avery jumped at the sound, then checked the time. It was 10:14.<br><br>"This is it," she whispered as it rang a second time.<br><br>"Answer it," Margo anxiously demanded.<br><br>Avery picked up the phone on the third ring. "Avery Delaney."<br><br>"Mr. Carter would like to see you in his office at ten-thirty, Miss Delaney."<br><br>She recognized the voice. Carter's secretary had a distinct Maine accent. "I'll be there."<br><br>Three pairs of eyes watched her as she hung up the phone. "Oh, boy," she whispered.<br><br>"What?" Margo, the most impatient of the group, demanded.<br><br>"Carter wants to see me."<br><br>"Uh-oh. That can't be good." Mel made the remark, and then, as if he realized he'd said something he shouldn't have, added, "You want us to go with you?"<br><br>"You'd do that?" Avery asked, surprised by the offer.<br><br>"I don't want to, but I would."<br><br>"It's okay. I'll take the bullet alone."<br><br>"I think we should all go," Margo said. "A mass firing. I mean, we're all in this together, right?"<br><br>"Yes," Avery agreed. "But you three tried to talk me out of going to Andrews. Remember? I'm the only one who screwed up." She stood, put the icepack on top of the file cabinet, and reached for her jacket.<br><br>"This can't be good," Mel repeated. "They're breaking the chain of command. It must be really bad to get the boss's boss involved. Carter was just promoted to head of in-house operations."<br><br>"Which means he's now the boss's boss's boss," Margo pointed out.<br><br>"I wonder if all the bosses will be there," Lou said.<br><br>"Right," Avery muttered. "Maybe all three of them want to take a turn firing me." She buttoned her suit jacket and then said, "How do I look?"<br><br>"Like someone tried to run over you," Mel said.<br><br>"Your hose are shredded," Margo told her.<br><br>"I know. I thought I had another pair in my drawer, but I didn't."<br><br>"I've got an extra pair."<br><br>"Thanks, Margo, but you're a petite, and I'm not. Mel, Lou, turn around or sit down."<br><br>As soon as they turned their backs, she reached up under her skirt and pulled off her panty hose. Then she put her heels back on.<br><br>She was sorry now she'd worn the suit. She usually wore pants and a blouse, but she was going to a luncheon today and so she'd pulled out all the stops and put on the Armani suit her aunt Carrie had sent as a present two years ago. The color was a wonderful taupe gray and had a matching sleeveless V neck shell. At one time there had been an obscene slit up the side, but Avery had sewn it together. It was a great-looking suit. Now it would be remembered as the suit she wore the day she got fired.<br><br>"Catch," Margo said as she threw the new package of panty hose at Avery. "These are the one-size-fits-all kind. They'll work just fine. You have to wear hose. You know the dress code."<br><br>Avery read the label. It did say the hose would fit every size. "Thanks," she said as she sat down again. Her legs were long, and she was afraid of tearing the hose when she pulled them up over her hips, but they seemed to fit.<br><br>"You're going to be late," Mel told her when she stood up again and adjusted her skirt. Why hadn't she noticed how short it was? The hem barely touched the top of her knees.<br><br>"I've got four minutes left." After she'd put on some lip gloss and clipped her hair back behind her neck with a barrette, she slipped the heels back on. Only then did she notice how loose the right heel was. She must have broken it when she slammed into the hood of the car.<br><br>Can't do anything about it now, she thought. She took a deep breath, straightened her shoulders, and limped toward the aisle. With every step, her left knee throbbed.<br><br>"Wish me luck."<br><br>"Avery," Mel shouted. He waited until she turned around, then hurled her clip-on ID. "You should probably wear this."<br><br>"Yeah, right. They'll want to take it from me before they escort me out of the building."<br><br>Margo called after her. "Hey, Avery, think of it this way--if you get fired, you won't have to worry about all the work piling up while you and your aunt chill out at that fancy spa."<br><br>"I haven't decided if I'm going to meet my aunt or not. She still thinks I'm chaperoning those kids around D.C."<br><br>"But now that that got canceled, you ought to go get pampered," Margo argued.<br><br>"That's right, you should go," Lou said. "You could stay at Utopia a whole month and work on your resume."<br><br>"Not helping, guys," Avery said without looking back.<br><br>Carter's office was four flights up. On any other day she would have taken the stairs as aerobic exercise, but her left knee ached too much, and the heel on her right shoe was too wobbly. She was exhausted by the time she reached the elevator. While she waited for it, she rehearsed what she would say when Carter asked what in God's name she thought she was doing.<br><br>The doors parted. She took a step forward and felt something snap. Glancing down, she spotted the heel of her shoe lodged in the seam between the elevator and the floor. Since she was alone, she hiked her skirt up and bent down on her good knee to pry the heel loose. It was then that the elevator doors closed on her head.<br><br>Muttering an expletive, Avery fell back. The car began to move and she grabbed the railing. She clutched the broken heel in her hand and pulled herself to her feet just as the doors opened on the first floor. By the time she reached the fourth floor, the elevator was full of passengers, and she was squeezed to the back of the car. Feeling like an idiot, she excused her way to the front and limped off.<br><br>Unfortunately, Carter's office was located at the end of a long corridor. The glass doors were so far away she couldn't even read the name etched above the brass handle.<br><br>Suck it up, she thought as she started walking. She was halfway there when she stopped to check the time and give her leg a rest. She had one minute. She could make it, she thought as she started walking again. Her barrette slipped out of her hair, but she caught it before it fell to the floor. She clipped it back in place and continued on. She was beginning to wish Mrs. Speigel's car had actually struck her. Then she wouldn't have to come up with any excuses, and Carter could call her at the hospital and fire her over the phone.<br><br>Suck it up, she repeated. Could it get any worse?<br><br>Of course it could. At precisely the second she was pulling the door open, her panty hose began to slip. By the time she'd limped over to the receptionist, the waistband was down around her hips.<br><br>The stately brunette woman wearing a knockoff Chanel suit looked a bit startled as she watched Avery approach.<br><br>"Miss Delaney?"<br><br>"Yes," she answered.<br><br>The woman smiled. "You're right on time. Mr. Carter will appreciate that. He keeps a tight schedule."<br><br>Avery leaned forward as the woman picked up the phone to announce her. "Is there a ladies' room close by?"<br><br>"It's down the hall, past the bank of elevators, on your left."<br><br>Avery glanced behind her and considered her options. She could be late for the appointment, try to run like hell down the mile-long hallway and rip off the damn pantyhose, or she could--<br><br>The receptionist interrupted her frantic thoughts. "Mr. Carter will see you now."<br><br>She didn't move.<br><br>"You may go inside," she said.<br><br>"The thing is . . ."<br><br>"Yes?"<br><br>Avery slowly straightened. The panty hose stayed put. Smiling, she said, "I'll go on in then."<br><br>She pivoted and held her smile as she grabbed the edge of the desk, and then tried to walk as though her shoe still had a heel. With any luck, Carter wouldn't even notice her condition.</p><h2>Sketching (12th printing): Drawing Techniques for Product Designers</h2><p><p><i>Sketching</i> is an incredibly broad and practical survey of sketching techniques for product designers.

ISBN: 0333197526; 9780333197523</p><p>In this sweeping historical narrative, Barbara Tuchman writes of the cataclysmic 14th century, when the energies of medieval Europe were devoted to fighting internecine wars and warding off the plague. Some medieval thinkers viewed these disasters as divine punishment for mortal wrongs; others, more practically, viewed them as opportunities to accumulate wealth and power. One of the latter, whose life informs much of Tuchman&#39;s book, was the French nobleman Enguerrand de Coucy, who enjoyed the opulence and elegance of the courtly tradition while ruthlessly exploiting the peasants under his thrall. Tuchman looks into such events as the Hundred Years War, the collapse of the medieval church, and the rise of various heresies, pogroms, and other events that caused medieval Europeans to wonder what they had done to deserve such horrors.Anyone who has read THE GUNS OF AUGUST or STILWELL AND THE AMERICAN EXPERIENCE IN CHINA, knows that Barbara Tuchman was one of the most gifted American writers of this century. Her subject was history, but her profiles of great men and great events are drawn with such power that reading Tuchman becomes a riveting experience<br><br>In A DISTANT MIRROR, Barbara Tuchman illuminates the Dark Ages. Her description of medieval daily life, the role of the church, the influence of the Great Plagues, and the social and political conventions that make this period of history so engrossing, are carefully woven into an integrated narrative that sweeps the reader along.<br><br> I am a particular devotee of medieval and pre Renaissance music, so Barbara Tuchman's brilliant analysis of this period has special meaning for me - and I hope for many others.<br><br>George Davidson, Director of Production, The Ballantine Publishing Group</p><h2>I Am That: The Science of Hamsa from the Vijnana Bhairava</h2><p>This commentary explains the philosophy and mystery of the Hamsa, the natural mantra of the breath, which was first revealed in the Vijnana Bhairava, an 8th century treatise.<br></p><p><b>Swami Muktananda</b> introduced the Siddha Yoga path all over the world, creating what he called a "meditation revolution."

That same season, The Great Salt Lake began to rise to record heights, threatening the herons, owls, and snowy egrets that Williams, a poet and naturalist, had come to gauge her life by. One event was nature at its most random, the other a by-product of rogue technology: Terry's mother, and Terry herself, had been exposed to the fallout of atomic bomb tests in the 1950s. As it interweaves these narratives of dying and accommodation, <b>Refuge</b> transforms tragedy into a document of renewal and spiritual grace, resulting in a work that has become a classic.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><p>The only constants in nature are change and death. Terry Tempest Williams, a naturalist and writer from northern Utah, has seen her share of both. The pages of <i>Refuge</i> resound with the deaths of her mother and grandmother and other women from cancer, the result of the American government's ongoing nuclear-weapons tests in the nearby Nevada desert. You won't find the episode in the standard history textbooks; the Feds wouldn't admit to conducting the tests until women and men in Utah, Nevada, and northwestern Arizona took the matter to court in the mid-1980s, and by then thousands of Americans had fallen victim to official technology. Parallel to her account of this devastation, Williams describes changes in bird life at the sanctuaries dotting the shores of the Great Salt Lake as water levels rose during the unusually wet early 1980s and threatened the nesting grounds of dozens of species. In this world of shattered eggs and drowned shorebirds, Williams reckons with the meaning of life, alternating despair and joy."Remarkable....Her demonstration of how deeply human emotional life can become intertwined with a particular landscape could not be more relevant to our lives."--Barry Lopez<br><br>"Profoundly moving...one of the most significant environmental essays of our time."--Kansas City Star</p><h2>The Beekeeper&#39;s Handbook, Third Edition</h2><p>Diana Sammataro and Alphonse Avitabile have revised and expanded their clear and comprehensive guide to cover changes in beekeeping.

CIP. Carolrhoda. May 1986. PLB $8.95. Grade 3-6 Four biographies that are compact and well written. All of the books employ an upbeat style of writing combined with occasional humor. While each of the subjects came from environments which emphasized concerns other than those which eventually became their personal missions, children are shown the connection between early interests and preoccupations and later achievements. Matzeliger and Carver are depicted in situations indicative of the racial intolerance of the late 19th and early 20th Centuries. Mitchell shows young readers the inequities of racial prejudice and portrays vividly the courage that these men displayed in the pursuit of their work. The biographies have a good sense of setting and contain much factual information. Dialogue does appear in all four stories, but it does not detract from credibility and is not used to excess. Of the four biographies, readers may find the one about Matzeliger, inventor of the shoe-lasting machine, to be the most enlightening, since far less has been written about him, and consequently, less is known of him than of the other three men. Black-and-white illustrations complement and enhance the texts. Karen P.

He serves as an excellent guide...

SHIPS NEXT BUSINESS DAY!</p><p>A solid reference work for gardeners throughout the south, Dallas-based landscaper Wasowski's second book offers more extensive coverage than her first ( Landscaping with Native Texas Plants ) of detailed landscape plans for regions from East Texas to El Paso and north to the Panhandle. Included are thorough climatic and soil type information, as well as an authoritative plant material list for Southern native plants. Though Wasowski includes common trees, shrubs and vines, she has dug deeper to compile a rich assortment of native ground covers, grasses, annuals and plants that will grow in water or bog gardens. And while the author's accessible prose primarily addresses the needs of Texas homeowners, her guide should also prove useful to professional out-of-state landscapers planning Texas sites.

Alternating between the technical wizardry, personality quirks, and feuds of these men, and the story of the growth of the industry itself and its influence over American life and leisure, the book is fast-paced, fun reading and doubles as a useful teaching tool for teachers of American history and culture, science, and mass communication. --Richard Lisker, Fairfax County Pub . Lib . , VA<br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.Lewis (English, Skidmore Coll.) tells the complex history of the development of radio in a clear and straightforward manner. He capably spans the transition from an emphasis on individual inventors to the formidable power and control of a united military/industrial establishment. The careers of inventors Lee de Forest and Edwin H. Armstrong, along with RCA chief David Sarnoff, comprise the book's framework. Lewis examines the technological advancements in the field of radio at the start of the 20th century, and the accompanying patent litigation which impacted the lives of the three men.

With eloquence equal to that of Thomas Jefferson and Tom Paine, and with a passionate love of God, Adams helped ignite the flame of liberty and made sure it glowed even during the Revolution's darkest hours. He was, as Jefferson later observed, "truly the man of the Revolution." <br> <br> In a role that many Americans have not fully appreciated until now, Adams played a pivotal role in the events leading up to the bloody confrontation with the British. Believing that God had willed a free American nation, he was among the first patriot leaders to call for independence from England. He was ever the man of action: He saw the opportunity to stir things up after the Boston Massacre and helped plan and instigate the Boston Tea Party, though he did not actually participate in it. A fiery newspaper editor, he railed ceaselessly against "taxation without representation." <br> <br> In a relentless blizzard of articles and speeches, Adams, a man of New England, argued the urgency of revolution. When the top British general in America, Thomas Gage, offered a general amnesty in June 1775 to all revolutionaries who would lay down their arms, he excepted only two men, John Hancock and Samuel Adams: These two were destined for the gallows. It was this pair, author Ira Stoll argues, whom the British were pursuing in their fateful march on Lexington and Concord. <br> <br> In the tradition of David McCullough's <i>John Adams</i>, Joseph Ellis's <i>The Founding Brothers</i>, and Walter Isaacson's <i>Benjamin Franklin</i>, Ira Stoll's <i>Samuel Adams</i> vividly re-creates a world of ideas and action, reminding us that none of these men of courage knew what we know today: that they would prevail and make history anew. <br> <br> The idea that especially inspired Adams was religious in nature: He believed that God had intervened on behalf of the United States and would do so as long asits citizens maintained civic virtue. "We shall never be abandoned by Heaven while we act worthy of its aid and protection," Adams insisted. A central thesis of this biography is that religion in large part motivated the founding of America. <br> <br> A gifted young historian and newspaperman, Ira Stoll has written a gripping story about the man who was the revolution's moral conscience. Sure to be discussed widely, this book reminds us who Samuel Adams was, why he has been slighted by history, and why he must be remembered.</p><p><b>Ira Stoll</b> was vice president and managing editor of <i>The New York Sun,</i> which he helped to found.

British troops controlled New York City. The Americans had lost the strategic stronghold of Fort Ticonderoga, in upstate New York, to the British in July. In Delaware, on September 11, troops led by General George Washington had lost the Battle of Brandywine, in which two hundred Americans were killed, five hundred wounded, and four hundred captured. In Pennsylvania, early in the morning of September 21, another three hundred American soldiers were killed or wounded and one hundred captured in a British surprise attack that became known as the Paoli Massacre. </p><p> Washington's troops were suffering from what one delegate to Congress called "fatigue occasioned by the bad rainy weather &amp; long night marches." The rain had soaked the American army's ammunition, making it useless. The American troops would spend the coming winter at Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, subsisting on firecakes made of flour and water, and leaving bloody footprints in the snow for lack of shoes; already one thousand of Washington's roughly nine thousand troops were barefoot. The delegates to Congress doubted their own generals. Charles Carroll of Carrollton, Maryland, wrote to General Washington, "I am sorry to observe that two officers in high command in our army are said to be much addicted to liquor: what trust, what confidence can be reposed in such men?" </p><p> The diplomatic situation was similarly unpromising for the revolutionaries. France had not yet agreed to an alliance with America. Some individual French officers volunteered on their own, but even they were suffering, or worse. The <i>Journals of Congress</i> for September 17 record that one "Mons. du Coudray, colonel brigadier in the service of his most Christian Majesty, the king of France, and commander in chief of the artillery in the French colonies of America, gallantly offered to join the American army as a volunteer, but, in his way thither, was most unfortunately drowned in attempting to pass the Schuylkill." The Congress resolved that the corpse of the man John Adams said had a reputation as "the most learned and promising officer in France" be buried "at the expence of the United States, and with the honors of war." </p><p> Burial with the honors of war was about the best that American political leaders could hope for. The enemy was closing in. Pennsylvanians lowered the 2,080-pound bronze bell from the spire of their State House, with its inscription from Leviticus, "Proclaim Liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof," and carted it to the basement of the Zion Reformed Church in Allentown for safekeeping. And just in time -- the British captured Pennsylvania's capital, Philadelphia, America's largest city, on September 26. Congress, which had been meeting there, fled briefly to Lancaster, Pennsylvania, then to York, a hundred miles west of Philadelphia. The departure from Philadelphia was frantic, prompted by an alarm from Washington's aide, Alexander Hamilton, who said the enemy soldiers were so close that one had shot his horse. One delegate to Congress was wakened by a servant at two in the morning and advised to abandon the city. A delegate from Virginia, Richard Henry Lee, evacuated Philadelphia in such a hurry that he left his extra clothes behind. </p><p> Another delegate to Congress, John Adams of Massachusetts, wrote in his diary, "The prospect is chilling, on every Side: Gloomy, dark, melancholly, and dispiriting." </p><p> The number of delegates present at Congress had dwindled to a mere twenty from the fifty-six members who had signed the Declaration of Independence in 1776. Those remaining gathered for a private meeting in York to question whether there was any hope of success. </p><p> One of those present was John Adams's cousin, the patriot leader Samuel Adams, who had already suffered losses that would have shattered an ordinary man. His first wife and four of their children died of natural causes before the war began. At the Battle of Bunker Hill, British officers decapitated Samuel Adams's close friend Joseph Warren and presented his head as a trophy to the British commanding general. Samuel Adams had spent the better part of three years at the Congress in Philadelphia separated from his two surviving children and his second wife. "Matters seem to be drawing to a crisis," he had written her recently. Back in Boston, the British soldiers ripped out the pews of Old South Church, where Samuel Adams's father had once worshipped, covered the floor with dirt, and used the church as a riding academy. Samuel Adams's own house in Boston was vandalized by British troops so badly that it was uninhabitable. If the Revolution failed, Samuel Adams could expect to meet the same fate at the hands of the British as Warren. </p><p> Yet on that day in York in late September 1777, Samuel Adams, a slightly heavy, gray-haired fifty-five-year-old with large dark blue eyes, a prominent nose, and a high forehead, gave his fellow members of Congress a talk of encouragement. </p><p> "If we despond, public confidence is destroyed, the people will no longer yield their support to a hopeless contest, and American liberty is no more," Samuel Adams said in the voice John Adams described as clear and harmonious. "Through the darkness which shrouds our prospects the ark of safety is visible. Despondency becomes not the dignity of our cause, nor the character of those who are its supporters." </p><p> He went on, comparing the American revolutionaries to the Israelites who had left the slavery of Egypt. According to Exodus, chapter 13, God had guided them in the wilderness with a "pillar of cloud by day" and a "pillar of fire by night." Samuel Adams addressed the delegates: </p><p> </p><blockquote> Let us awaken then, and evince a different spirit, -- a spirit that shall inspire the people with confidence in themselves and in us, -- a spirit that will encourage them to persevere in this glorious struggle, until their rights and liberties shall be established on a rock. We have proclaimed to the world our determination "to die freemen, rather than to live slaves." We have appealed to Heaven for the justice of our cause, and in Heaven we have placed our trust. Numerous have been the manifestations of God's providence in sustaining us. In the gloomy period of adversity, we have had "our cloud by day and pillar of fire by night." We have been reduced to distress, and the arm of Omnipotence has raised us up. Let us still rely in humble confidence on Him who is mighty to save. Good tidings will soon arrive. We shall never be abandoned by Heaven while we act worthy of its aid and protection. </blockquote> <p> When Samuel Adams said that the "ark of safety" was visible "through the darkness," he turned out to be prescient. On October 17, at Saratoga, north of Albany, New York, the American general Horatio Gates accepted the surrender of 5,800 British soldiers led by General John Burgoyne. The American troops seized from the British twenty-seven pieces of artillery and thousands of pieces of small arms and ammunition. </p><p> Detailed news of the victory at the Battle of Saratoga did not reach Congress at York until October 31, but when it did it was greeted with exuberance. "We had almost began to despair, but at length our joy was full," wrote a congressman from Connecticut, Eliphalet Dyer. The president of the Congress, Henry Laurens of South Carolina, wrote, "the glorious intelligence is now extending from City to City diffusing Joy in the heart of every Loyal American." The victory at Saratoga turned the tide of the war. News of it was decisive in bringing France into a full alliance with America against the British. Samuel Adams joked that Gates's messenger, who had dawdled for a day between Saratoga and York courting a young woman he later married, should be presented with spurs and a horsewhip. </p><p> On November 1, just after receiving news of the victory at Saratoga, Congress adopted a report drafted by Samuel Adams, declaring Thursday, December 18, as "a day of thanksgiving" to God, "particularly in that he hath been pleased in so great a measure to prosper the means used for the support of our troops and to crown our arms with most signal success." The resolution went on to say that the day would be set aside so that: </p><p> </p><blockquote> with one heart and one voice the good people may express the grateful feelings of their hearts, and consecrate themselves to the service of their divine benefactor; and that together with their sincere acknowledgments and offerings, they may join the penitent confession of their manifold sins, whereby they had forfeited every favour, and their humble and earnest supplication that it may please God, through the merits of Jesus Christ, mercifully to forgive and blot them out of remembrance; that it may please him graciously to afford his blessing on the governments of these states respectively, and prosper the public council of the whole; to inspire our commanders both by land and sea, and all under them, with that wisdom and fortitude which may render them fit instruments, under the providence of Almighty God, to secure for these United States the greatest of all human blessings, independence and peace; that it may please him to prosper the trade and manufactures of the people and the labour of the husbandman, that our land may yet yield its increase; to take schools and seminaries of education, so necessary for cultivating the principles of true liberty, virtue and piety, under his nurturing hand, and to prosper the means of religion for the promotion and enlargement of that kingdom which consisteth "in righteousness, peace and joy in the Holy Ghost." </blockquote> ...</p><h2>The Christmas Promise (Christmas Hope Series #4)</h2><p><p><i>Each Christmas we are given a promise from heaven.

Looks like a nice one, I said to myself, straining to see out the window. Someone had left a refrigerator in my driveway. I squeezed dishwashing liquid into the bottom of the bucket and filled it with warm water, splashing my hand till it disappeared in suds. I tied up my running shoes&#x2014;the sassy pink neon ones with the green stripes&#x2014;and slipped a bottle of household cleaner into my coat pocket. A blown porch light stopped me on the steps and I looked up at it. &#x201c;Good grief. That bulb didn&#x2019;t last very long. I need to get one of those bulbs that last a year.&#x201d; I stepped into the kitchen and reached to the top shelf of the utility closet. Back on the porch, I unscrewed the old bulb from the bottom of the light casing. &#x201c;There you go,&#x201d; I said, screwing in the new one.<br>I turned to the refrigerator in the driveway, sizing it up. &#x201c;Not too big. Twenty cubic feet, I&#x2019;d guess.&#x201d; I opened the door and backed away, holding my hand over my nose. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll have you cleaned and find a new home for you by lunchtime,&#x201d; I said, slipping on a pair of bright yellow latex gloves. I was used to talking to myself; I&#x2019;d been a widow for seven years. I was never concerned about talking to myself; what worried me is how I answered myself, and I was really troubled when I argued with myself! I pulled out one shelf after another, soaking my rag and scrubbing at unrecognizable globs of petrified food. I sprayed down the inside and tackled the back wall with a vengeance.<br>&#x201c;There is a junk law, you know!&#x201d; I cringed at hearing that familiar voice and closed my eyes. Maybe if I couldn&#x2019;t see her she wouldn&#x2019;t actually be there. &#x201c;The city has mandated codes.&#x201d; I scrubbed harder. &#x201c;Gloria Bailey, I&#x2019;m talking to you.&#x201d;<br>How I despised that tone. I took a breath and lifted my head to see my neighbor standing on the other side of her fence. &#x201c;Good morning, Miriam.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Gloria, does anyone ever bother to let you know that they&#x2019;re dropping this rubbish off?&#x201d;<br>I shoved my head inside the fridge, scrubbing at the walls. I once told my friend Heddy that there wasn&#x2019;t enough room in the cosmos for Miriam&#x2019;s ego. Her affected British accent was as real as her blond hair and her name. Miriam Lloyd Davies. Come on! &#x201c;It&#x2019;ll be gone by noon, Miriam,&#x201d; I said, wringing out the rag.<br>&#x201c;I doubt it, by the looks of it,&#x201d; Miriam said. &#x201c;But if it&#x2019;s not gone I&#x2019;ll need to have it hauled out of here. I don&#x2019;t pay taxes to live next to a junkyard.&#x201d;<br>It&#x2019;s amazing how perfect your posture becomes when you&#x2019;ve been insulted. Every vertebra in my back straightened to supreme alignment as I walked up the driveway. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t pay taxes to live next to a junkyard!&#x201d; I said, whispering.<br>When I moved into my home six years ago a lovely young couple with two small children lived in the house next door. They were always polite, smiling and waving each day, even leaving a present on my doorstep each Christmas. If my work annoyed them, they never showed it. Miriam moved in three years ago when the young couple found themselves expecting a third child and in need of a larger home. She was graceful and statuesque&#x2014;fitting for a stage actress and professor&#x2019;s wife&#x2014;but I found her to be cold and distant, although her husband, Lynn, was always gracious and warm. Lynn died a year after moving into the home. I tried on several occasions to befriend Miriam, assuming our widow status would assure some sort of bond between us, but just because someone is plopped into your life doesn&#x2019;t mean a friendship will be forged.<br>I often felt pasted together, compared to Miriam&#x2019;s refined look. I looked my age (sixty and proud of it) while Miriam denied hers (fifty and holding). I&#x2019;ve never been what you could call fashionable, but I take pride in my appearance. I like my clothes to match and am most comfortable in cotton and jersey (but no belts). I don&#x2019;t wear anything that hurts! Miriam preferred slacks with a designer blouse or cashmere sweater and she was always neat, nothing disheveled about her. Her hair was the color of golden honey and framed her face in a chic bob. She promptly made her next appointment at the beauty salon for five weeks to the date of her last cut and coloring. My hair was salt and pepper (more salt than pepper) and hung in soft, or rather, annoying curls around my face. When it got too long I simply bobby-pinned it back until I found the time to give myself a trim.<br>I walked into the kitchen and dialed a number on the phone, listening as it rang in my ear. I was about to hang up when the line clicked on the other end. &#x201c;Hello! Heddy?&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got a fridge. Can you look through the list and see who needs what?&#x201d;<br>I heard Heddy rustling through papers. Dalton Gregory was the retired school superintendent and his wife, Heddy, was a nurse at the hospital who was on duty when I had my gallbladder taken out four years ago. We&#x2019;ve been taking stuff from you ever since, Heddy once said. I couldn&#x2019;t do my work without them. They had the organizational skills that I sorely lacked. I relied on sticky notes and miscellaneous paper scraps to remind myself of appointments or calls, and my idea of filing was stacking things on the kitchen table. Dalton and Heddy kept everything on computer and could pull it up with the touch of a finger. I still wasn&#x2019;t entirely sure how to turn on a computer.<br>&#x201c;A family with three children called yesterday,&#x201d; Heddy said. &#x201c;Their refrigerator broke four days ago and the father is in the hospital. The mother hasn&#x2019;t had any time to look for a new one.&#x201d;<br>I peered through the drapes and watched Miriam nosing around the refrigerator. I shook my head, watching her. &#x201c;Can Dalton come pick it up and deliver it?&#x201d; I rapped on the window and Miriam jumped, making me laugh. She threw her nose in the air and marched to her own yard. &#x201c;Sooner than later, Heddy. Miriam Lloyd Snooty Face is riding her broom again.&#x201d;Years earlier, I had been driving home late one winter night when, near the downtown bridge, I noticed a homeless man with a red hat who wasn&#x2019;t wearing socks with his shoes. I couldn&#x2019;t get the image of the man out of my mind. What if that had been my own son? Would anyone have helped? Days later I walked into Wilson&#x2019;s Department Store and found socks for ninety-nine cents a pair in a discount bin at the back of the store. &#x201c;What would it cost if I bought the whole bin?&#x201d; I had asked owner Marshall Wilson.<br>&#x201c;Tell you what,&#x201d; Marshall had said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll donate all these and hats and scarves to your cause.&#x201d; I hadn&#x2019;t realized I was championing a &#x201c;cause,&#x201d; but when I delivered the clothes out of the back of my trunk I knew that the cause had found me. People needed help right in my own backyard. I had been slumping around and feeling sorry for myself long enough and needed to do something about it.<br>&#x201c;Thank you, Miss Glory,&#x201d; the man with the red hat had said. The name Miss Glory stuck. Since that time I&#x2019;d taken in whatever I could get my hands on and given it out to the homeless and families in need, especially young single mothers with children. My husband and I had four children and I couldn&#x2019;t imagine having raised them by myself.<br>I taught cooking in my home along with simple classes like how to make a budget and basic child care. Dalton taught computer and job interviewing courses, but all our classes were small. I didn&#x2019;t have the space in my house for large groups.&#x201c;He&#x2019;ll be there in a bit,&#x201d; Heddy said. &#x201c;Then Miriam won&#x2019;t have anything to complain about.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I doubt that,&#x201d; I said.<br>&#x201c;Gloria?&#x201d; Heddy&#x2019;s voice changed and I wondered what was wrong. &#x201c;We got word that Rikki Huffman was charged with drug possession last night.&#x201d;<br>I fell into a chair at the kitchen table. Rikki was a single mom I&#x2019;d been working with for the last two years who seemed to be getting her feet on the ground. &#x201c;No! She was doing so great. Where is she?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;They have her at County.&#x201d; Heddy was quiet. &#x201c;She&#x2019;ll spend time in jail with this offense, Gloria.&#x201d; I assumed that, but still hoped Heddy would say something else. &#x201c;Are you all right?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Not really,&#x201d; I said, rubbing my head. &#x201c;Who has her kids?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;DFS. The Department of Family Services will place them. Maybe they already have. You&#x2019;ve done everything you could for Rikki. You know that, right?&#x201d;<br>I sighed. &#x201c;My mind knows that, sure.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Rikki just can&#x2019;t break the cycle,&#x201d; Heddy said. I was quiet. &#x201c;Gloria? Gloria!&#x201d;<br>I jumped at her voice. &#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t blame yourself.&#x201d; That always proved to be easier said than done for me. &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t save everyone. It&#x2019;s not your job.&#x201d;<br>I hung up the phone and sat at the table, thinking about Rikki for the longest time.

Schacter's <i>The Seven Sins of Memory</i> dusts off an old topic and finds material of both practical and theoretical interest. Chairman of Harvard's Department of Psychology, Schacter knows his stuff and how to present it memorably. Organizing the book by examining each of seven "sins," such as absent-mindedness and suggestibility, Schacter slowly builds his case that these sometimes enraging bugs are actually side effects of system features we wouldn't want to do without. For example, when we focus our attention on one aspect of our surroundings, we inevitably draw attention away from others:<p> </p><blockquote> Consider this scenario: if you were watching a circle of people passing a basketball and someone dressed in a gorilla costume walked through the circle, beat his chest, and exited, of course you would notice him immediately--wouldn't you? [Researchers] filmed such a scene and showed it to people who were asked to track the movement of the ball by counting the number of passes made by one of the teams. Approximately half of the participants failed to notice the gorilla.</blockquote><p> Scientists concerned about interesting a general audience would do well to use more gorilla suits. Schacter elegantly weaves this curiosity into his text along with clinical stories and frontline research. Recent advances in brain imaging have boosted his field considerably, and the formerly remote psychological territory has yielded plenty of exciting discoveries. Though some of the practical material seems like reheated common sense (Haunted by a traumatic memory? Talk about it.), it's backed up by solid scientific work. Write a note, tie string around the finger, or hire an assistant for reminders, but by all means remember to pick up a copy of <i>The Seven Sins of Memory</i>. <i>--Rob Lightner</i></p>Daniel L. Schacter is chairman of the Psychology Department at Harvard University. He has previously written Searching for Memory, which received praise as a New York Times Notable Book of the Year and one of Library Journal&#x2019;s Best Science and Technology Books of the Year. The book won the American Psychological Association&#x2019;s William James Book Award and received outstanding reviews in The New Yorker and Publishers Weekly. Schacter was the keynote speaker at the American Psychological Association&#x2019;s 2000 conference and has appeared on 20/20, NBC&#x2019;s Sunday Today, the Discovery Channel, the Learning Channel, and, with Alan Alda, on PBS&#x2019;s Scientific American Frontiers.</p><h2>Exercise Technique Manual for Resistance Training-2nd Edition</h2><p>Beefed up from 38 to 57 exercises, this new edition of <i>Exercise Technique Manual for Resistance Training</i> is a must for any professional library. It will help readers prepare for the NSCA&#x2019;s Certified Strength and Conditioning Specialist exam or its Certified Personal Trainer exam. It will also serve as a valuable reference for personal trainers and fitness instructors. Also, college and university faculty who teach courses in resistance training can use the manual and DVDs to complement hands-on instruction and demonstration or to teach exercise technique without going to a weight room. <br><br> This resource provides clear descriptions for those performing resistance training exercises or for those who instruct others. The manual gives detailed explanations on technique for each free-weight and machine exercise, and the accompanying DVDs show the movements for each exercise in action. Readers using this manual to study for the CSCS or NSCA-CPT exams will find this resource particularly helpful as they prepare for exam questions relating to anatomy, biomechanics, program design, and exercise technique. <br><br> <i>Exercise Technique Manual for Resistance Training, Second Edition,</i> contains the following features:<ul> <li>Extremely thorough checklists for 57 resistance training exercises, helping readers safely perform the exercises or oversee the safe and correct performance of them </li><li>Instruction from experts who were selected and approved by the NSCA </li><li>Over 140 photos that demonstrate proper execution of the exercises </li><li>Accurate exercise technique for each exercise on the DVDs, which also highlights some of the most common incorrect techniques</li></ul> The manual and DVDs supply 5 total-body, 14 lower-body, 36 upper-body, and 2 abdominal exercises. For each exercise, the manual details the type of exercise (e.g., whether it is a single-joint or multi-joint exercise), the predominant muscle groups and muscles involved, and technique guidelines from beginning to end, including starting position, downward movements, and upward movements. When appropriate, the manual also covers transitions, catches, and other phases. It offers spotting guidelines, safety suggestions, weight belt recommendations, and breathing guidelines. <br><br> The result is a complete manual with expert guidance in safely performing common resistance training exercises&#x2014;something that both professionals and students can use to further their careers.</p><p><b>The National Strength and Conditioning Association (NSCA)</b>, a nonprofit educational group, was established in 1978 to generate and disseminate information about strength training and conditioning to its members and the general public. Evolving from a membership of 76 in 1978, it now has more than 30,000 members in over 63 countries, including international chapters in Japan, China, and the United Kingdom. The NSCA is widely recognized as an international clearinghouse for strength training and conditioning research, theories, and practices. <br><br> Central to the NSCA&#x2019;s mission is providing a link between the scientist in the laboratory and the practitioner in the field. By working to find practical applications for new findings in strength training and conditioning research, the organization has fostered the development of strength training and conditioning as a discipline and as a profession. <br><br> The NSCA offers two distinctive credentialing programs. The Certified Strength and Conditioning Specialist (CSCS) credential is the certification of choice for professionals who design and implement strength and conditioning programs for athletes, and the NSCA-Certified Personal Trainer (NSCA-CPT) credential is an ideal certification program for those who train active and sedentary clients in one-on-one situations. <br><br> The NSCA&#x2019;s prestigious CSCS and NSCA-CPT certifications are the only programs in the fitness industry that have been nationally accredited since 1993 by the National Commission for Certifying Agencies, a non-governmental, nonprofit agency in Washington, DC, that sets national standards for certifying agencies. To earn one of these internationally recognized certifications, candidates must pass a rigorous exam administered by an independent exam service. To date, more than 35,000 professionals residing in 59 countries hold one or both of the NSCA&#x2019;s credentials.</p><h2>Resolution</h2><p>Relocating to an Old-West saloon town in the aftermath of the events in Appaloosa, Everett Hitch takes a job protecting the women in a house of ill repute but finds his peace at the side of an old friend challenged by a hired gun and a greedy mine owner. By the owner of Now &amp; Then. 150,000 first printing.</p><p>Robert B. Parker was the author of more than fifty books. He died in January 2010.Mystery stalwart Parker&#x2019;s 2005 western Appaloosa may have surprised a few folks, but really, where better than the Old West for his terse, punchy dialogue; buddy-bond themes; and propulsive, rock-steady storytelling? This follow-up finds Everett Hitch in the town of Resolution, drawing pay for peacekeeping the Blackfoot Saloon, owned by a scheming cross-eye who goes by the name of Wolfson. When trouble starts, Hitch remembers the words of his partner, Virgil Cole: &#x201c;Sometimes you got to kill one person early, to save from killing four or five later.&#x201d; Well, Virgil ain&#x2019;t always right, and after he arrives in town to lope around with Hitch, a war breaks out between Wolfson and pretty much the rest of the community. Between gunfights, the two heroes moralize on the law&#x2014;there isn&#x2019;t a stranger or funnier scene in any western than the two gunmen jawing over The Social Contract by &#x201c;Russo&#x201d;&#x2014;and wonder if they aren&#x2019;t on the wrong side of the fight. With a healthy, but not overly graphic, body count and a gravelly cadence of yep- and nope-based banter, it doesn&#x2019;t take Parker long to clean up a town. If he&#x2019;s disposed to take much more time away from Spenser et al., here&#x2019;s to hoping he&#x2019;ll linger awhile with Cole and Hitch. --Ian Chipman</p><h2>The Visitor (English Garden, Book 3)</h2><p><p>When Londoner Alexander Tate is thrown from his horse, his vision that suffers most.

Largely ignored at first, the book would eventually be considered Freud&#x2019;s most important work, one that, like Darwin&#x2019;s &amp;&amp;LI&amp;&amp;RThe Origin of Species&amp;&amp;L/I&amp;&amp;R, revolutionized the way human beings view themselves.&amp;&amp;L/P&amp;&amp;R&amp;&amp;LP style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&amp;&amp;R&nbsp;&amp;&amp;L/P&amp;&amp;R&amp;&amp;LP style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&amp;&amp;RThe raw material for &amp;&amp;LI&amp;&amp;RThe Interpretation of Dreams&amp;&amp;L/I&amp;&amp;R was provided by Freud himself. Spurred on by the death of his father, he began analyzing his own dreams, in the process recreating lost childhood memories and uncovering the roots of his own neuroses. He concluded that dreams were filled with latent meaning, their bizarre imagery and peculiar narratives concealing deep-seated, instinctual motives and desires. For example, his own problems stemmed from a repressed desire for his mother and hostility towards his father&#x2015;the now-famous Oedipal complex. By revealing how the seemingly trivial nonsense of dreams reflect important personal issues in the dreamer&#x2019;s present and past life, Freud created a key that unlocked the vital secrets of the unconscious mind.&amp;&amp;L/P&amp;&amp;R&amp;&amp;LP style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&amp;&amp;R&nbsp;&amp;&amp;L/P&amp;&amp;R&amp;&amp;LP style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&amp;&amp;RA fascinating and beautifully written book, &amp;&amp;LI&amp;&amp;RThe Interpretation of Dreams&amp;&amp;L/I&amp;&amp;R is an indefinable masterpiece that helped shape the mind of the twentieth century.&amp;&amp;L/P&amp;&amp;R&amp;&amp;LP style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&amp;&amp;R&nbsp;&amp;&amp;L/P&amp;&amp;R&amp;&amp;LDIV&amp;&amp;R&amp;&amp;LSTRONG&amp;&amp;RDaniel T.

Much of this revolution can be traced to <i>The Interpretation of Dreams</i>, the turn-of-the-century tour de force that outlined his theory of unconscious forces in the context of dream analysis. Introducing the id, the superego, and their problem child, the ego, Freud advanced scientific understanding of the mind immeasurably by exposing motivations normally invisible to our consciousness. While there's no question that his own biases and neuroses influenced his observations, the details are less important than the paradigm shift as a whole. After Freud, our interior lives became richer and vastly more mysterious.<p> These mysteries clearly bothered him--he went to great (often absurd) lengths to explain dream imagery in terms of childhood sexual trauma, a component of his theory jettisoned mid-century, though now popular among recovered-memory therapists. His dispassionate analyses of his own dreams are excellent studies for cognitive scientists wishing to learn how to sacrifice their vanities for the cause of learning. Freud said of the work contained in <i>The Interpretation of Dreams</i>, "Insight such as this falls to one's lot but once in a lifetime." One would have to feel quite fortunate to shake the world even once. <i>--Rob Lightner</i></p>Freud&#39;s discovery that the dream is the means by which the unconscious can be explored is undoubtedly the most revolutionary step forward in the entire history of psychology. Dreams, according to his theory, represent the hidden fulfillment of our unconscious wishes.</p><h2>Order of the Stick, Vol. 1: Dungeon Crawlin Fools</h2><p>The Order of the Stick: Dungeon Crawlin&#39; Fools follows the comic strip adventures of six stick-figure heroes as they brave the perils of your favorite fantasy roleplaying game.

Ambrose, one of the country's most influential historians, reflects on his long career as an American historian and explains what an historian's job is all about. He celebrates America's spirit, which has carried us so far. He confronts its failures and struggles. As always in his much acclaimed work, Ambrose brings alive the men and women, famous and not, who have peopled our history and made the United States a model for the world. Taking a few swings at today's political correctness, as well as his own early biases, Ambrose grapples with the country's historic sins of racism, its neglect and ill treatment of Native Americans, and its tragic errors (such as the war in Vietnam, which he ardently opposed on campus, where he was a professor). He reflects on some of the country's early founders who were progressive thinkers while living a contradiction as slaveholders, great men such as Washington and Jefferson. He contemplates the genius of Andrew Jackson's defeat of a vastly superior British force with a ragtag army in the War of 1812. He describes the grueling journey that Lewis and Clark made to open up the country, and the building of the railroad that joined it and produced great riches for a few barons. Ambrose explains the misunderstood presidency of Ulysses S. Grant, records the country's assumption of world power under the leadership of Theodore Roosevelt, and extols its heroic victory of World War II. He writes about women's rights and civil rights and immigration, founding museums, and nation- building. He contrasts the presidencies of Dwight Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy, Richard Nixon, and Lyndon B. Johnson. Throughout, Ambrose celebrates the unflappable American spirit. Most important, Ambrose writes about writing history. "The last five letters of the word 'history' tell us that it is an account of the past that is about people and what they did, which is what makes it the most fascinating of subjects." <i>To America</i> is an instant classic for all those interested in history, patriotism, and the love of writing.</p><p>"I am a storyteller by training and inclination," writes the late Stephen Ambrose in <i>To America</i>, his final book. And what a storyteller. One of the most respected and popular historians of his era, Ambrose had a passion for making the events of the past both relevant and entertaining. In these pages, he touches on many of the subjects that he devoted his career to, including presidents Eisenhower and Nixon, the journey of Lewis and Clark, the building of the transcontinental railroad, and the citizen soldiers of World War II. He also writes about his own personal story and his role as a historian. In detailing a family camping trip to Wounded Knee (an outing which directly led to his dual biography of Crazy Horse and George Armstrong Custer) or offering tips on vivid historical writing (keep your narration in chronological order; keep the reader guessing; and never use the passive voice), he shares what it is like to reflect upon the triumphs and mistakes of the past and why it is so important to pass those stories on to the next generation.<p> In this brief yet satisfying book, Ambrose moves seamlessly from one topic to the next with contagious enthusiasm and unapologetic optimism. Along the way he points out the inherent absurdity of political correctness, and even takes himself to task for past biases and for sometimes failing to consider his subjects within the context of their own times and not his own. He does not shy away from writing about America's sins, both past and present, but Ambrose's undying faith in his country and his fellow citizens is inspiring. <i>--Shawn Carkonen</i></p><b>Stephen E.

But, as Will Johnson shows, the physical aspect of the practice is far too often underemphasized. The alert-yet-relaxed sitting posture that is the common denominator of so many meditative techniques is a wonderful aid for clearing the mind and opening the heart, but it also works to activate the natural healing energies of both body and mind. The author offers guidance and exercises for working with the posture of meditation and advice on how to carry its benefits on into all the rest of life.</p><p>Will Johnson is a certified bodyworker and director of the Institute for Embodiment Training in his hometown of Cobble Hill, British Columbia."Ordinarily," Johnson opens his superbly calm little manual, "we think of meditation as an activity involving our minds, but in truth meditation is initiated by assuming a specific gesture with our bodies." That gesture or posture is the cross-legged sitting familiarly associated with Buddhist meditation and consists of three elements: alignment, relaxation, and resilience. The objects of these physical practices are to offer gravity the least resistance while in an alert yet resting state and to experience the subtle movements of existence. Johnson explains the functions of each element, offers instruction and advice on achieving each of them, and discusses how they may be carried into everyday life in a prose so limpidly intelligent that this book may become a standard text for beginning meditators. <i>Ray Olson</i></p><h2>Brushwork Essentials: How to Render Expressive Form and Texture with Every Stroke</h2><p><p><b>The Keys To Superior Painting Can Be Yours!</b></p><p>These are the brushstrokes with which great oil paintings are created.

In<i> City of Fortune, </i>Roger Crowley, acclaimed historian and <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>Empires of the Sea, </i>applies his narrative skill to chronicling the astounding five-hundred-year voyage of Venice to the pinnacle of power. <br>&nbsp;<br>Tracing the full arc of the Venetian imperial saga for the first time, <i>City of Fortune</i> is framed around two of the great collisions of world history: the ill-fated Fourth Crusade, which culminated in the sacking of Constantinople and the carve-up of the Byzantine Empire in 1204, and the Ottoman-Venetian War of 1499&#x2013;1503, which saw the Ottoman Turks supplant the Venetians as the preeminent naval power in the Mediterranean. In between were three centuries of Venetian maritime dominance&#x2014;years of plunder and plague, conquest and piracy&#x2014;during which a tiny city of &#x201c;lagoon dwellers&#x201d; grew into the richest place on earth. <br>&nbsp;<br>Drawing on firsthand accounts of pitched sea battles, skillful negotiations, and diplomatic maneuvers, Crowley paints a vivid picture of this avaricious, enterprising people and the bountiful lands that came under their dominion. Defiant of emperors, indifferent to popes, the Venetians saw themselves as reluctant freebooters, compelled to take to the open seas &#x201c;because we cannot live otherwise and know not how except by trade.&#x201d; From the opening of the spice routes to the clash between Christianity and Islam, Venice played a leading role in the defining conflicts of its time&#x2014;the reverberations of which are still being felt today. Only an author with Roger Crowley&#x2019;s deep knowledge of post-Crusade history could put these iconic events into their proper context. <br>&nbsp;<br>Epic in scope, magisterial in its understanding of the period, <i>City of Fortune</i> is narrative history at its most engrossing.</p><p><b>Roger Crowley</b> was born in 1951 and spent part of his childhood in Malta. He read English at Cambridge University and taught English in Istanbul, where he developed a strong interest in the history of Turkey. He has traveled extensively throughout the Mediterranean basin over many years and has a wide-ranging knowledge of its history and culture. He lives in Gloucestershire, England. He is also the author of <i>1453: The Holy War for Constantinople</i> <i>and</i> <i>The Clash of Islam and the West</i> and <i>Empires of the Sea: The Siege of Malta, the Battle of Lepanto, and the Contest for the Center of the World.</i>Chapter 1<br><br>. _1 _.<br><br>LORDS OF DALMATIA<br><br>1000-1198<br>The Adriatic Sea is the liquid reflection of Italy, a tapering channel some 480 miles long and 100 wide, pinched tighter at its southern point where it flows into the Ionian past the island of Corfu. At its most northern point, in the enormous curved bay called the Gulf of Venice, the water is a curious blue-green. Here the river Po churns out tons of alluvial material from the distant Alps, which settle to form haunting stretches of lagoon and marsh. So great is the volume of these glacial deposits that the Po Delta is advancing fifteen feet a year and the ancient port of Adria, after which the sea is named, now lies fourteen miles inland.<br><br>Geology has made the Adriatic's two coasts quite distinct. The western, Italian shore is a curved, low-lying beach, which provides poor harbors but ideal landing spots for would-be invaders. Sail due east and your vessel will snub against limestone. The shores of Dalmatia and Albania are a four-hundred-mile stretch as the crow flies, but so deeply crenellated with sheltering coves, indents, offshore islands, reefs, and shoals that they comprise two thousand miles of intricate coast. Here are the sea's natural anchorages, which may shelter a whole fleet or conceal an ambush. Behind these features, sometimes stepped back by coastal plain, sometimes hard down on the sea, stand the abrupt white limestone mountains that barricade the sea from the upland Balkans. The Adriatic is the frontier between two worlds.<br><br>For thousands of years-from the early Bronze Age until well after the Portuguese rounded Africa-this fault line was a marine highway linking central Europe with the eastern Mediterranean, and a portal for world trade. Ships passed up and down the sheltering Dalmatian shore with the goods of Arabia, Germany, Italy, the Black Sea, India, and the farthest East. Over the centuries they carried Baltic amber to the burial chamber of Tutankhamen; blue faience beads from Mycenae to Stonehenge; Cornish tin to the smelters of the Levant; the spices of Malacca to the courts of France; Cotswold wool to the merchants of Cairo. Timber, slaves, cotton, copper, weapons, seeds, stories, inventions, and ideas sailed up and down these coasts. "It is astonishing," wrote a thirteenth-century Arab traveler about the cities of the Rhine, "that although this place is in the Far West, there are spices there which are to be found only in the Far East- pepper, ginger, cloves, spikenard, costus, and galanga, all in enormous quantities." They came up the Adriatic. This was the point where hundreds of arterial routes converged. From Britain and the North Sea, down the river Rhine, along beaten tracks through the Teutonic forests, across Alpine passes, mule trains threaded their way to the top of the gulf, where the merchandise of the East also landed. Here goods were transshipped and ports flourished; first Greek Adria, then Roman Aquileia, and finally Venice. In the Adriatic, site is everything: Adria silted up; Aquileia, on the coastal plain, was flattened by Attila the Hun in 452; Venice prospered in the aftermath because it was unreachable. Its smattering of low-lying muddy islets set in a malarial lagoon was separated from the mainland by a few precious miles of shallow water. This unpromising place would become the entrep�t and interpreter of worlds; the Adriatic, its passport.<br><br>._._.<br><br>From the start the Venetians were different. The first, rather idyllic snapshot we have of them, from the Byzantine legate Cassiodorus in 523, suggests a unique way of life, independent and democratic:<br><br>You possess many vessels . . . [and] . . . you live like seabirds, with your homes dispersed . . . across the surface of the water. The solidity of the earth on which they rest is secured only by osier and wattle; yet you do not hesitate to oppose so frail a bulwark to the wildness of the sea. Your people have one great wealth-the fish, which suffices for them all. Among you there is no difference between rich and poor; your food is the same, your houses are alike. Envy, which rules the rest of the world, is unknown to you. All your energies are spent on your salt fields; in them indeed lies your prosperity, and your power to purchase those things which you have not. For though there may be men who have little need of gold, yet none live who desire not salt.<br><br>The Venetians were already carriers and suppliers of other men's needs. Theirs was a city grown hydroponically, conjured out of marsh, existing perilously on oak palings sunk in mud. It was fragile to the sea's whim, impermanent. Beyond the mullet and eels of the lagoon, and its salt pans, it produced nothing-no wheat, no timber, little meat. It was terribly vulnerable to famine; its sole skills were navigation and the carrying of goods. The quality of its ships was critical.<br><br>Before Venice became the wonder of the world, it was a curiosity; its social structure, enigmatic; and its strategies, distrusted. Without land, there could be no feudal system, no clear division between knight and serf. Without agriculture, money was its barter. Its nobles would be merchant princes who could command a fleet and calculate profit to the nearest grosso. The difficulties of life bound all its people together in an act of patriotic solidarity that required self-discipline and a measure of equality-like the crew of a ship all subject to the perils of the deep.<br><br>Geographical position, livelihood, political institutions, and religious affiliations marked Venice out. It lived between two worlds: the land and the sea, the East and the West, yet belonging to neither. It grew up a subject of the Greek-speaking emperors in Constantinople and drew its art, its ceremonials, and its trade from the Byzantine world. Yet the Venetians were also Latin Catholics, nominal subjects to the pope, Byzantium's anti-Christ. Between such opposing forces they struggled to maintain a particular freedom. The Venetians repeatedly defied the pope, who responded by excommunicating the whole city. They resisted tyrannous solutions to government and constructed for themselves a republic, led by a doge, whom they shackled with so many restraints that he could receive no gift from foreigners more substantial than a pot of herbs. They were intolerant of overambitious nobles and defeated admirals, whom they exiled or executed, and devised a voting system to check corruption as labyrinthine as the shifting channels of their lagoon.<br><br>The tenor of their relations with the wider world was set early. The city wished to trade wherever profit was to be made without fear or favor. This was their rationale and their creed and they pleaded it as a special case. It earned them widespread distrust. "They said many things to excuse themselves . . . which I do not recollect," spat a fourteenth-century churchman after watching the Republic wriggle free of yet another treaty (though he could undoubtedly remember the details painfully well), "excepting that they are a quintessence and will belong neither to the Church nor to the emperor, nor to the sea nor to the land." The Venetians were in trouble with both Byzantine emperors and popes as early as the ninth century for selling war materials to Muslim Egypt, and while purportedly complying with a ban on trade with Islamic countries around 828, they managed to spirit away the body of Saint Mark from Alexandria under the noses of Muslim customs officials, hidden in a barrel of pork. Their standard excuse was commercial necessity: "because we cannot live otherwise and know not how except by trade." Alone in all the world, Venice was organized for economic ends.<br><br>By the tenth century they were selling Oriental goods of extraordinary rarity at the important fairs at Pavia on the river Po: Russian ermine, purple cloth from Syria, silk from Constantinople. One monkish chronicler had seen the emperor Charlemagne looking drab beside his retinue in Oriental cloth bought in Pavia from Venetian merchants. (Particularly singled out for clerical tut-tutting was a multicolored fabric interwoven with the figures of birds-evidently an item of outrageous foreign luxury.) To the Muslims Venice traded back timber and slaves-literally Slavs until that people became Christian. Venice was by now well placed at the head of the Adriatic to become the pivot of trade, and on the round turning of the millennium, Ascension Day in the year 1000, Doge Pietro Orseolo II, a man who "excelled almost all the ancient doges in knowledge of mankind," set sail on an expedition that would launch the Republic's ascent to wealth, power, and maritime glory.<br><br>On the threshold of the new era, the city stood finely poised between danger and opportunity. Venice was not yet the compact mirage of dazzling stone that it would later become, though its population was already substantial. No splendid palazzi flanked the great S bend of the Grand Canal. The city of wonder, flamboyance, and sin, of carnival masks and public spectacle lay centuries ahead. Instead, low wooden houses, wharves, and warehouses fronted the water. Venice comprised less a unity than a succession of separate islets with patches of undrained marsh and open spaces among the parish settlements, where people grew vegetables, kept pigs and cows, and tended vines. The Church of Saint Mark, a plain predecessor of the extraordinary basilica, had recently been badly burned and patched up after political turmoil that had left a doge dead in its porch; the square in front of it was beaten earth, divided by a canal and partially given over to an orchard. Seagoing vessels that had sailed to Syria and Egypt crowded the commercial heart of the city, the Rivo Alto-contracted over time into the Rialto. Everywhere masts and spars protruded above the buildings.<br><br>It was the genius of Orseolo to fully understand that Venice's growth, perhaps its very survival, lay far beyond the waters of the lagoon. He had already obtained favorable trading agreements with Constantinople, and, to the disgust of militant Christendom, he dispatched ambassadors to the four corners of the Mediterranean to strike similar agreements with the Islamic world. The future for Venice lay in Alexandria, Syria, Constantinople, and the Barbary Coast of North Africa, where wealthier, more advanced societies promised spices, silk, cotton, and glass-luxurious commodities that the city was ideally placed to sell on into northern Italy and central Europe. The problem for Venetian sailors was that the voyage down the Adriatic was terribly unsafe. The city's home waters, the Gulf of Venice, lay within its power, but the central Adriatic was risky to navigate, as it was patrolled by Croat pirates. Since the eighth century these Slav settlers from the upper Balkans had established themselves on its eastern, Dalmatian shores. This was a terrain made for maritime robbery. From island lairs and coastal creeks, the shallow-draft Croat ships could dart out and snatch merchant traffic passing down the strait.<br><br>Venice had been conducting a running fight with these pirates for 150 years. The contest had yielded little but defeat and humiliation. One doge had been killed leading a punitive expedition; thereafter the Venetians had opted to pay craven tribute for free passage to the open seas. The Croats were now seeking to extend their influence to the old Roman towns farther up the coast. Orseolo brought to this problem a clear strategic vision that would form the cornerstone of Venetian policy for all the centuries that the Republic lived. The Adriatic must provide free passage for Venetian ships, otherwise they would be forever bottled up. The doge ordered that there would be no more tribute and prepared a substantial fleet to command obedience.<br><br>Orseolo's departure was accompanied by one of those prescient ceremonies that became a defining marker of Venetian history. A large crowd assembled for a ritual mass at the Church of Saint Peter of Castello, near the site of the present arsenal. The bishop presented the doge with a triumphal banner, which perhaps depicted for the first time Saint Mark's lion, gold and rampant on a red background, crowned and winged, ready for war even as the open gospel between his paws declares peace. The doge and his force then stepped aboard, and with the west wind billowing in their sails, surged out of the lagoon into the boisterous Adriatic. Stopping only to receive further blessing from the bishop of Grado they set sail for the peninsula of Istria on the eastern tip of the Adriatic.<br><br>Orseolo's campaign could almost serve as the template for subsequent Venetian policy: a mixture of shrewd diplomacy and the precise application of force. As the fleet worked its way down the small coastal cities-from Parenzo to Pola, Ossero to Zara-the citizens and bishops came out to demonstrate their loyalty to the doge and to bless him with their relics. Those who wavered, weighing Venice against the counterthreat of the Slavs, were more readily convinced by the visible show of force. The Croats saw what was coming and tried to buy the doge off. Orseolo was not to be turned, though his task was made harder by the coastal terrain. The pirates' stronghold was well protected, hidden up the marshy delta of the Narenta River and beyond the reach of any strike force. It was shielded by the three barrier islands of Lesina, Curzola, and Lagosta, whose rocky fortresses presented a tough obstacle.<br><br>Relying on local intelligence, the Venetians ambushed a shipload of Narentine nobles returning from trade on the Italian shore and used them to force submission from the Croats at the mouth of the delta. The latter swore to forgo the annual tribute and harassment of the Republic's ships. Only the offshore islands held out. The Venetians isolated them one by one and dropped anchor in their harbors. Curzola was stormed. Lagosta, "by whose violence the Venetians who sailed through the seas were very often robbed of their goods and sent naked away," offered more stubborn resistance. The inhabitants believed their rocky citadel to be impregnable. The Venetians unleashed a furious assault on it from below; when that failed, a detachment made their way up by a steep path behind the citadel and captured the towers that contained the fort's water supply. The defense collapsed. The people were led away in chains and their pirates' nest was demolished.<br><br>With this force de frappe, Orseolo put down a clear marker of Venetian intentions, and in case any of the subject cities had forgotten their recent vows, he retraced his footsteps, calling at their startled ports in a repeat show of strength, parading hostages and captured banners. "Thence, passing again by the aforesaid town, making his way back to Venice, he at length returned with great triumph." Henceforward, the doge and his successors awarded themselves a new honorific title-Dux Dalmatiae-"Lord of Dalmatia."</p><h2>Windows and Doors: Expert Advice from Start to Finish (Taunton&#39;s Build Like a Pro)</h2><p>This comprehensive guide covers all aspects of an often daunting task, including prepping and adjusting basic and specialized types of doors and windows.

Michael Berg is 15 when he begins a long, obsessive affair with Hanna, an enigmatic older woman. He never learns very much about her, and when she disappears one day, he expects never to see her again. But, to his horror, he does. Hanna is a defendant in a trial related to Germany's Nazi past, and it soon becomes clear that she is guilty of an unspeakable crime. As Michael follows the trial, he struggles with an overwhelming question: What should his generation do with its knowledge of the Holocaust? "We should not believe we can comprehend the incomprehensible, we may not compare the incomparable.... Should we only fall silent in revulsion, shame, and guilt?

What does it mean to love those people--parents, grandparents, even lovers--who committed the worst atrocities the world has ever known? And is any atonement possible through literature? Schlink's prose is clean and pared down, stripped of unnecessary imagery, dialogue, and excess in any form. What remains is an austerely beautiful narrative of the attempt to breach the gap between Germany's pre- and postwar generations, between the guilty and the innocent, and between words and silence. <i>--R.

In time she becomes his lover--then she inexplicably disappears. When Michael next sees her, he is a young law student, and she is on trial for a hideous crime. As he watches her refuse to defend her innocence, Michael gradually realizes that Hanna may be guarding a secret she considers more shameful than murder.</p><h2>Inverting the Pyramid: The History of Football Tactics</h2><p><p>Whether it's Terry Venables keeping his wife up late at night with diagrams on scraps of paper spread over the eiderdown, or the classic TV sitcom of moving the salt &amp; pepper around the table top in the transport cafe, football tactics are now part of the fabric of everyday life.

This manual is designed for professional conservators, librarians, private collectors, and researchers who want practical, contemporary insight into preserving architectural plans and drawings. The authors provide detailed methods for identifying architectural photoreproductions based on visual examination. The manual discusses twelve distinct processes and offers additional information on several other methods commonly used in North American architectural practice from 1860 to approximately 1960. One of the manual&#39;s important features is the flowchart, an outline using a series of questions leading the reader to a preliminary identification. Each process is described in a separate chapter with numerous color illustrations of general and magnified views of select photoreproductions. Each chapter includes sections on how to identify a print, trade names and synonyms, the history and use of the printing process, how a print was manufactured, and degradation and storage considerations. Each of the 54 illustrations, critical for identifying a document&#39;s state of condition and extent of damage, have been carefully photographed and checked to ensure correct color representation. Appendices give information on storage and handling, exhibition and current methods of reproduction of architectural prints and drawings.</p><p>El�onore Kissel is a Paper Conservator and a Consultant in Preventative Conservation.

Mediterranean cooks know how to make eating a pleasure. They do it simply&#x2015;with olive oil and garlic; with herbs and spices; with tomatoes and eggplants, peppers and squash, figs and peaches, and other seasonal produce. And of course there is crusty bread and local cheese, the freshest yogurt and endless wine. </p><p>In this authoritative and anecdotal cookbook, award-winning author Martha Rose Shulman captures the vibrant flavors of the Mediterranean region in more than 500 delicious vegetarian dishes that will appeal to everyone. The book represents years of meticulous research gleaned from Shulman's travels through France, Spain, Italy, the Balkans, Greece, Turkey, North Africa, and the Middle East. She presents authentic contemporary variations as well. You'll dine with her in Greek olive groves, feast on torecipes handed down from mother to daughter for generations, and she offers her own matoes and fresh sardines in Croatia, savor coffee gelato in the streets of Bologna. At every turn in the road there is a new culinary reward. </p><p>Whether you are a vegetarian or a dedicated meat eater, Shulman's recipes are substantial enough to satisfy any appetite. Included are such tempting creations as Majorcan Bread and Vegetable Soup, Proven�al Chick Pea Salad, Pasta with Ligurian Artichoke Sauce, Greek Cauliflower Gratin with Feta and Olives, Balkan-Style Moussaka, North African Carrot "Compote," and Sweet Dessert Couscous with Citrus and Pomegranate. There is also an entire chapter devoted to the renowned "little foods" of the Mediterranean: tapas from Spain, antipasti and merende from Italy; meze from the eastern and southern Mediterranean, and more. In addition, the book features a glossary of useful cookware and indispensable pantry staples and the best online sources for hard-to-find ingredients. </p><p>As Martha Rose Shulman herself says, "Mediterranean food enthralls me." Readers of this classic will be enthralled as well.</p></p><p><b>MARTHA ROSE SHULMAN </b>is the author of more than 25 books, including <i>Mediterranean Light</i>, the Julia Child Award-winning <i>Proven�al Light</i>, and the IACP Award-winning <i>Entertaining Light</i>.

She lives in Los Angeles.Cooking Mediterranean Food<br><br>Mediterranean food is easy to cook. That's one of the things I like about it: It's straightforward. It's also forgiving. When you follow one of these recipes, you might find yourself short on an ingredient, like garlic, or parsley. If you use two cloves instead of four, or have to forgo that tablespoon of parsley, your dish will still taste good (as long as you make sure to taste it). Forgot to buy peppers for your ratatouille? Make an eggplant and zucchini stew without the peppers; it'll be wonderful.<br><br>I myself use much less olive oil than cooks in the Mediterranean are accustomed to using. In that sense, some of the recipes in this book are not quite authentic. When I approach a dish, I always ask myself how much oil is really needed for the dish to taste good and to cook the ingredients sufficiently. To my palate, it's usually less than is called for in the authentic recipe. Not that you won't find a few deep-fried dishes here, like falafel and a deep-fried cauliflower dish from the Middle East that I have always found irresistible. But I have left out others, like beignets and other fritters, which could have had a place in these pages.<br><br>Kitchen Equipment<br><br>You need little in the way of fancy equipment and kitchen skills for these recipes. All that is required is that you pay attention, as you must do in all cooking. A good knife and the ability to use it to chop produce; a large, heavy frying pan and some wooden spoons and spatulas; a couple of lidded saucepans and a soup pot will easily get you started.<br><br>The list of equipment that follows covers the items I used for testing the recipes in <i>Mediterranean Harvest.</i><br><br><b>KNIVES AND CUTTING BOARDS</b><br><br><b>Chef's knife:</b> The most important tool in your kitchen is your chef's knife. I use a sturdy stainless-steel 8-inch knife. (Some cooks prefer a longer blade.) Keep it sharp by honing it and sharpening it regularly. A dull knife can be more dangerous than a sharp one.<br><br><b>Paring knife:</b> The other essential knife is a good, sturdy paring knife.<br><br><b>Knife steel:</b> For regular honing of your knives; get into the habit of honing before and after each use.<br><br><b>Serrated bread knife:</b> You can also use it for slicing tomatoes.<br><br><b>Large cutting board (or boards):</b> It's important to have a large, heavy cutting board. You'll be amazed by how much space two chopped onions can take up, and it's so convenient to have them all in front of you and not spilling onto the floor. I prefer wood, though I have some small plastic ones for the odd job. I like to use a wooden or plastic cutting board with a lip for tomatoes and other juicy foods like stone fruits, melons, and citrus, so that the juice runs into the canal and not onto my floor.<br><br><b>GADGETS</b><br><br><b>Mortar and pestle:</b> This is still not a common item in most American kitchens, but a mortar and pestle really is essential in the Mediterranean kitchen. Once you have one around, you'll use it all the time. I have a small marble one for crushing small amounts of spices or garlic, and a larger, olive wood mortar for larger quantities of food.<br><br><b>Kitchen scale:</b> I have a mechanical scale with a large, wide bowl, and a digital one. You don't need both. Just choose a scale with a surface large enough to rest a medium-size bowl on.<br><br><b>Kitchen timer:</b> I am totally dependent on my digital kitchen timers. Especially for long-simmering dishes, you'll need to be reminded to check them as you go about the rest of your day's business. Using a timer can be a great stress-reducer when it comes to cooking; you don't have to be watching your own watch. I like the digital timers because they will ring for a minute, and I can hear mine from two rooms away. And once they stop ringing, they begin to count up, so you will know exactly how long you've continued to cook something if you didn't get to it right away.<br><br><b>Wooden spoons and spatulas:</b> Look for large, long-handled spoons with wide bowls. If you travel, always look for wooden spoons in markets. Some of my best, widest spoons, with really useful long handles, came from markets in Brazil and Mexico. Wooden implements will last much longer if you don't wash them in the dishwasher.<br><br><b>Chinese wire-mesh deep-fry skimmer (or spider):</b> I use this wire-mesh implement all the time, and not for deep-frying. Mostly I use it to transfer blanched greens and other vegetables from boiling water to a bowl of cold water, or pasta to a serving bowl. It's one of my most useful tools.<br><br><b>Cheese grater:</b> I find that the one I use most often is the little rotary Mouli that I've had since I began to cook.<br><br><b>Microplane:</b> One of the great new gadgets to come into our kitchens in the last 20 years is this long, fine grater that looks like a carpenter's plane. I use mine for zesting citrus, for grating small amounts of Parmesan and Romano cheese, and for grating nutmeg.<br><br><b>Strainer:</b> A medium-size strainer, the kind you can find in a supermarket, is an item I could not be without.<br><br><b>Salad spinner:</b> Another essential. I find it as useful for cleaning herbs and greens like Swiss chard as I do for washing lettuce.<br><br><b>Heavy rolling pin:</b> For rolling out crusts.<br><br><b>Stainless-steel bowls:</b> Have as many as you have room for. Large ones are very useful for mixing up ingredients for tarts, gratins, casseroles, and for all sorts of food prep.<br><br><b>Pyrex measuring cups:</b> Have a 2-cup and a 4-cup for liquids.<br><br><b>Nesting measuring cups:</b> Stainless or plastic for dry ingredients.<br><br><b>Measuring spoons:</b> Have two sets, one for dry ingredients and one for wet.<br><br><b>Spray bottle, or mister:</b> I use mine to spray breads when I bake them. The moisture helps the bread to develop a hard, crunchy crust.<br><br><b>Pasta rolling machine:</b> You can buy attachments for some standing mixers, but the most reliable machine for rolling and cutting pasta may be the inexpensive hand-crank models that clamp to a table or work surface.<br><br><b>COOKWARE</b><br><br>Heavy Nonstick Cookware<br><br>The quality of nonstick cookware has improved tremendously. As restaurants have begun to choose them for their high-volume line-cooking, manufacturers have had to come up with nonstick cookware that can withstand restaurant wear-and-tear and the high heat of commercial stoves. You can now find this heavy-duty cookware in a range of stores, from fancy cookware stores, to hardware stores, to restaurant supply outlets. Make sure to look for the heavy restaurant pans. I have great, moderately priced pans made by WearEver, NordicWare, and my current favorite, Anolon.<br><br>CARE OF NONSTICK COOKWARE<br><br>Nonstick cookware has come a long way since the days of peeling Teflon. But you still have to take precautions so the pots and pans won't scratch. You should also take care not to expose them to extremely high temperatures.<br><br>. Always use wooden spoons or heatproof plastic when stirring food. . Wash nonstick cookware carefully in warm water, and avoid using rough surfaces to clean. The cookware will last longer if you keep it out of the dishwasher. . If you have to stack the pans to store them, place paper towels between them, or stack in reverse order of size so that the bottom of one pan doesn't scratch the inside of another. . Do not heat nonstick cookware when empty. Once food has been removed, remove the pan from the heat. Overheating the cookware could release volatile elements from the nonstick surface into the air.<br><br><b>12-inch skillet:</b> I use this pan more than any other single item in my <i>batterie de cuisine.</i><br><br><b>12-inch straight-sided, lidded pan (5.3-quart/5-liter capacity):</b> This saute pan is known as a <i>sauteuse</i> in traditional French cooking. I use mine quite often for braises and stews. It doubles as a casserole or Dutch oven and is very useful because of its nonstick surface.<br><br><b>10-inch skillet:</b> I use this much less often than my 12-inch, but it's useful for cooking smaller amounts, and for making frittatas.<br><br><b>8-inch omelet pan:</b> I use this pan to make small omelets, of course, but I also use it all the time for toasting nuts and cooking small amounts of garlic.<br><br>Casseroles and Dutch Ovens<br><br><b>Heavy 5-quart casserole:</b> For beans, stews, ragouts, and soups. I like a heavy heatproof and ovenproof Dutch oven that can be used both on top of the stove and in the oven. The cookware that I have been using since I began to cook, and that I still swear by, is Le Creuset enameled cast iron. Every recipe in this book that calls for a large, heavy casserole or Dutch oven was made in my 5.3-quart (5-liter) round lidded casserole. These are expensive, but they will last more than a lifetime (I am also using some of my mother's enameled cast iron bought in the 1940s). They hold the heat beautifully and are attractive enough to double as serving dishes.<br><br><b>Earthenware casseroles:</b> These are traditional in Spanish and North African cooking. Placed on a flame tamer, earthenware pots are wonderful for long, slow, gentle simmers. The next best thing is the enameled cast iron I discuss above.<br><br>Saucepans and Other Pots<br><br><b>Heavy nonaluminum saucepans:</b> I use my heavy Le Creuset 2 1/2-quart, 2- quart, and 1-quart saucepans the most, for making rice and sauces. I am specifying nonaluminum here, because aluminum reacts with acidic foods like tomatoes and iron-rich foods like spinach, and changes their flavor.<br><br><b>Light saucepans:</b> A set of light enameled, stainless, or nonstick, saucepans, inexpensive ones that you can find in a supermarket, is useful for steaming and blanching vegetables, and for boiling eggs.<br><br><b>8-quart (or larger) pasta pot:</b> A pasta pot with a basket insert can be very useful. I use the pot as often to blanch vegetables as I do for cooking pasta. The pot can double as a stockpot.<br><br><b>Couscoussiere:</b> This large double boiler, the traditional piece of equipment for making couscous, has small holes in the upper portion, which allows steam to reach the nuggets of semolina. You substitute with a colander or sieve (see How to Prepare Packaged Couscous, page 337).<br><br>Baking Dishes<br><br><b>2-quart and 3-quart gratin or rectangular baking dishes:</b> I have both earthenware and Le Creuset, and use them interchangeably, both for savory baked dishes and desserts.<br><br><b>Lasagna pan:</b> This is optional, but it's just the right size for making lasagnas with no-boil pasta. Mine measures 10 x 12 inches.<br><br><b>Tart pan and pie pan:</b> I use both my 10 1/2-inch fluted white porcelain tart pan and my classic 10-inch metal tart pan with a removable bottom. I recommend that you have two, so that you can keep a frozen crust on hand in the freezer. I also use my 10-inch Pyrex pie pan.<br><br><b>Half-sheet pans (aka baking sheets, sheet trays):</b> That's what standard 12 1/2 x 17 1/2-inch baking sheets with the 1/2-inch lip are called in the restaurant trade. Have at least two; you will use them all the time.<br><br><b>14-inch pizza pan:</b> For pizzas and galettes. It also doubles as a cover for my 12-inch nonstick skillet.<br><br><b>9-inch or 10-inch springform pan:</b> I use mine as often for savory pies as I do for cakes. There are now a number of excellent nonstick springform pans available.<br><br><b>Baking stone:</b> A ceramic baking stone will radiate the heat in your oven, mimicking a bread stone or pizza oven. If you are a baker, you'll want one for country breads and pizzas. Terracotta tiles can be substituted.<br><br><b>ELECTRICS</b><br><br><b>Electric spice mill:</b> It's worth investing in an extra coffee mill so that you can grind spices in seconds. Put a piece of tape on the top that says SPICES ONLY! And label your coffee mill with COFFEE ONLY! That way your spices won't end up smelling like coffee and vice versa.<br><br><b>Mini processor:</b> This is a miniature food processor that I use all the time when I need more than one minced garlic clove or minced ginger. It's also great for pesto.<br><br><b>Food processor:</b> Worth the investment for purees like hummus and baba gannouj. But don't use it for chopping; it massacres onions and doesn't chop evenly.<br><br><b>Electric mixer:</b> An electric mixer isn't called for too often in this book, except for mixing up breads. If you bake a lot, it's worth your while to have a free-standing mixer like a KitchenAid.<br><br><b>Hand-held blender:</b> This blender on a stick, also known as an immersion blender, is terrific for pureeing soups right in the pot.<br><br><b>Blender:</b> When a silky texture is important, as with gazpacho, a blender works better than a food processor.<br><br><b>Ice cream maker:</b> Even the simplest ice cream makers now seem to be powered by electricity. You will need one to make the sorbets and gelatos in the book.<br><br><b>Panini grill:</b> These hinged, double-sided grills make a wonderful addition to your kitchen. Use them for grilling sandwiches and also for grilling vegetables like sliced eggplant and zucchini, and quartered bell peppers.<br><br>The Mediterranean Pantry<br><br>Each region of the Mediterranean has its own set of indispensable ingredients, many of them overlapping from one area to another. The story of the Mediterranean is a story of the rise and fall of empires and city- states, of trade between nations. Foods have traveled and taken root as different conquerors have come and gone. Long after the conquering peoples have retreated, foodways have remained.<br><br><b>OLIVES AND OLIVE OIL</b><br><br>The olive is the defining food of the entire Mediterranean basin. If there is one ingredient that runs through all of the cuisines, the olive is it. Foods of all kinds are cooked in and dressed with its oil; olives that are not destined for oil are cured and eaten everywhere, at breakfast (particularly in Turkey and the Middle East), lunch, and dinner.<br><br>When freshly picked, olives are incredibly bitter. In order for olives to be edible, the bitter com�ds must be leached out through a curing process. There are essentially three different ways to cure olives. The industrial olives produced in large quantities are usually cured in a lye solution, which is very fast but unfortunately also leaches out much of the olives' flavor. Water- and brine-curing is a slower, more natural method for curing olives. The fruit is soaked in vats of fresh water or saltwater brine, or in the case of kalamata olives, a red wine vinegar brine, for several weeks or months, until the bitter com�ds leach out. The liquid is changed regularly, and as the olives are cured, they are also seasoned.<br><br>Dry-cured olives are rubbed with salt and left to cure in the salt for several weeks or months. The salt draws out the moisture and with it the bitter com�ds. Then the salt is removed, and the olives are either coated with olive oil (as in North Africa) or aged in brine (as in Nice and Nyons). Dry-cured olives are intense, and those that are not brined have a wrinkled appearance and the texture of dried fruit. I find that oiled dry- cured olives can sometimes be too salty for my taste. My favorite olives, the ones I find most versatile, are those that have first been salted, then aged in brine.</p><h2>Your Brain at Work: Strategies for Overcoming Distraction, Regaining Focus, and Working Smarter All Day Long</h2><p><p><strong>In this revised edition updated with new findings, a researcher and consultant burrows deep inside the heads of one modern two-career couple to examine how each partner processes the workday&#x2015;revealing how a more nuanced understanding of the brain can allow us to better organize, prioritize, recall, and sort our daily lives.</strong></p><p>Emily and Paul are the parents of two young children, and professionals with different careers.

It&#x2019;s a story about a man whose life reads as if it were torn from the pages of an action novel: Bullet holes through his clothing. Horses shot out from under him. Unimaginable hardship. Disease. Heroism. Spies and double-agents. And, of course, the unmistakable hand of Divine Providence that guided it all.<br> <br> Being George Washington is a whole new way to look at history. You won&#x2019;t simply read about the awful winter spent at Valley Forge&#x2014;you&#x2019;ll live it right alongside Washington. You&#x2019;ll be on the boat with him crossing the Delaware, in the trenches with him at Yorktown, and standing next to him at the Constitutional Convention as a new republic is finally born.<br> <br> Through these stories you&#x2019;ll not only learn our real history (and how it applies to today), you&#x2019;ll also see how the media and others have distorted our view of it. It&#x2019;s ironic that the best-known fact about George Washington&#x2014;that he chopped down a cherry tree&#x2014;is a complete lie. It&#x2019;s even more ironic when you consider that a lie was thought necessary to prove he could not tell one.<br> <br> For all of his heroism and triumphs, Washington&#x2019;s single greatest accomplishment was the man he created in the process: courageous and principled, fair and just, respectful to all. But he was also something else: flawed.<br> <br> It&#x2019;s those flaws that should give us hope for today. After all, if Washington had been perfect, then there would be no way to build another one. That&#x2019;s why this book is not just about being George Washington in 1776, it&#x2019;s about the struggle to be him every single day of our lives. Understanding the way he turned himself from an uneducated farmer into the Indispensable (yet imperfect) Man, is the only way to build a new generation of George Washingtons that can take on the extraordinary challenges that America is once again facing.</p><p>Glenn Beck, the nationally syndicated radio host and founder of TheBlaze television network, has written thirteen #1 bestselling books and is one of the few authors in history to have had #1 national bestsellers in the fiction, nonfiction, self-help, and children&#x2019;s picture book genres.

New York City had, in battle after battle, been ingloriously lost. Even the outpost named for Lee himself&#x2014;New Jersey&#x2019;s &#x201c;Fort Lee&#x201d;&#x2014;had been abandoned. Philadelphia seemed next. Thousands of rebel soldiers had been lost, either slain in battle or now bound in heavy iron chains. Thousands more had simply vanished and gone home.<br> <br>It was mid-morning, nearing ten o&#x2019;clock, yet General Lee sat quietly in his soiled, rumpled cap and dressing gown, here at the widow Mary White&#x2019;s two-storied, two-chimneyed tavern in Basking Ridge, New Jersey. The slovenly Lee cheerfully munched upon his eggs and hard bread and plentiful portions of bacon and ham, occasionally pausing to fling a scrap or two of what had recently been ambulatory swine to the ravenous pack of faithful hounds who seemingly accompanied this strange man wherever he traveled. Between munches and flings, Lee took quill pen in hand to inscribe a letter to General Horatio Gates furiously raging against their mutual superior, George Washington. &#x201c;A certain man,&#x201d; Lee scribbled hurriedly, &#x201c;is damnably deficient.&#x201d;<br> <br>Lee wrote rapidly for a very good reason: All hell was breaking loose. To enjoy this breakfast (and perhaps more of the company of the tavern&#x2019;s comely ladies), Lee had foolishly separated himself from his troops&#x2014;troops he had long delayed bringing southward from New York state to reinforce Washington&#x2019;s woefully depleted forces. Troops that were now busily heading for a semblance of safety across the ice-choked Delaware River in Pennsylvania. Only a handful of guards had accompanied Lee and his aide to the widow White&#x2019;s tavern.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re surrounded, you traitor, Lee!&#x201d; came a shout from outside. &#x201c;Surrender or forfeit your worthless life!&#x201d; The startled Lee finished writing his last sentence, breaking his quill point as he did, and sprang from his seat. Falling to his knees, he peered out from the bottom of a nearby sill to view a squad of green-jacketed British dragoons, their muskets at the ready.<br> <br>Lee could not be sure which one had shouted, but that was the least of his problems.<br> <br>It was, in fact, twenty-two-year-old Cornet Banastre Tarleton, among the most capable and vicious men fighting under the Union Jack. Lee bolted from his table and scurried for safety just as the hard-faced Tarleton&#x2019;s men unleashed a cascade of fire. Smoke and deafening thunder&#x2014;and lead shot&#x2014;filled the air. Several of Lee&#x2019;s guards fell dead or wounded.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hide here!&#x201d; screamed a barmaid. &#x201c;Hide in my bed!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d die first!&#x201d; shouted Lee, as his hounds growled and barked and ran about the house in panic. &#x201c;I will fight to the last!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll burn the house down! To the ground!&#x201d; shouted Tarleton. &#x201c;You have five minutes to surrender!&#x201d;<br> <br>Charles Lee&#x2019;s last came very soon. But it ended with neither death nor victory. Now attired in his old blue coat and battered cock hat, his breeches spattered with grease, he merely shuffled out the tavern&#x2019;s front door. His captors hustled him upon a horse and sounded a bugle as Charles Lee was led away to a British camp at Brunswick.<br> <br>December 1776<br>Trenton, New Jersey<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s going on?&#x201d; Colonel Johann Gottlieb Rall questioned. The gruff, fifty-year-old &#x201c;Hessian Lion&#x201d; spoke no English. He spoke only war&#x2014;and contempt for his Amerikanischen adversaries. Before him, he saw a body carried forward. Another Hessian soldier hobbled past him, assisted by two more grenadiers, blood still seeping freely from the bandages wrapped tightly just above his left knee.<br> <br>&#x201c;Another ambush, Colonel Rall. Corporal Schmidt killed. Shot straight through the heart. Private Keller wounded,&#x201d; answered Lieutenant Andreas von Wiederholdt, who had recently begun to appear much older than his forty-four years. His soldiers could not venture a step outside this miserable village of Trenton without being fired upon by these rebel madmen. Even being within its limits offered little safety. A shot from the woods&#x2014;blam!&#x2014;might be fired into the back of an unsuspecting sentry patrolling Trenton&#x2019;s outskirts. And what could anyone hope to do about it?<br> <br>Wiederholdt and his men could no longer rest decently at night. They remained on constant alert, fitfully sleeping in their blue-and-black uniforms, ready to spring into action at a moment&#x2019;s notice and confront a patriot&#x2019;s musket. The darkening bags under Wiederholdt&#x2019;s eyes and the disheveled nature of his own once invariably neat, brass-buttoned uniform revealed that.<br> <br>A column of men appeared on the horizon, on the road leading northward out of the town, but they were too far away to clearly identify. Was it the Americans? Daring to attack us directly? Wiederholdt&#x2019;s bony face froze in fear. But now he noticed something&#x2014;shafts of reflected sunlight danced about the head of each figure advancing toward him, emanating from the tall, pointed, polished brass helmet that each Hessian grenadier so proudly wore. It was, Wiederholdt now saw, merely Lieutenant Jakob Piel&#x2019;s company trudging home from a fourteen-mile march to the British outpost at Princeton. A small, very relieved smile played across his thin lips.<br> <br>Rall could not but help notice Wiederholdt&#x2019;s cascading emotions. &#x201c;Ha!&#x201d; he joked to his subordinate. &#x201c;You see Americans everywhere! Are you a soldier or an old woman?&#x201d;<br> <br>Wiederholdt silently accepted the insult. Who is Rall bluffing? he thought. He knows what&#x2019;s going on; that it&#x2019;s unsafe for messengers&#x2014;or anyone&#x2014;out there. These Americans hate us. They see us as invaders&#x2014;oppressors. That&#x2019;s why we have to send a hundred troops to guard a single messenger to Princeton!<br> <br>But Wiederholdt was not about to maintain his silence about everything. &#x201c;Colonel Rall,&#x201d; he said deferentially, hoping not to agitate his commandant too much, &#x201c;perhaps we should now move to fortify Trenton. I know Colonel von Donop has recommended erecting redoubts on both the upper end of town and along the river.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Donop!&#x201d; snapped Rall. &#x201c;Dummkopf! Let the Americans come! So much the better! If they dare to come we will have at them with our bayonets&#x2014;and that will be the end of George Washington!&#x201d;<br> <br>December 1776<br>(George Washington&#x2019;s headquarters)<br>Outside the farmhouse of Robert Merrick<br>Ten miles north of Trenton Falls<br>Bucks County, Pennsylvania<br> <br>Perhaps it would be the end of George Washington&#x2014;and of his revolution.<br> <br>Colonel Rall certainly thought Washington was on the ropes.<br> <br>General Lee had thought so as well.<br> <br>And so, though he hated to admit it, did Thomas Paine.<br> <br>It was no comfortable Philadelphia print shop in which Paine now sat. Patriotism meant more than words to the English-born pamphleteer. At forty, he now wore the short brown jacket and feathered hat of his unit of the Philadelphia Associators militia, &#x201c;The Flying Camp.&#x201d;<br> <br>Since August, Washington had done nothing but retreat. But while so many others had fled (only two days earlier he had been among those ordered to evacuate Fort Lee), Paine had remained and now, by flickering campfire light, employing the taut calfskin of a Continental Army drumhead as his desk, he scratched out the words of a new pamphlet. Hard circumstances demanded hard truths. Events mandated a call to action worthy of a sounding trumpet.<br> <br>Normally, Tom Paine wrote slowly and painfully&#x2014;but that was a luxury he could no longer afford. He paused&#x2014;but only for his smallish hand to dip a sharpened quill once more into the blackness of his pewter inkpot. His piercing blue eyes ablaze, he rapidly composed word after word in the fine penmanship he had learned as a boy in England. Before long he&#x2019;d completed his task.<br> <br>&#x201c;My good man! Come here!&#x201d; Paine demanded of an army courier, a rough-hewn frontiersman from the Pennsylvania backwoods who was mounted atop a horse that looked like it had served with its rider in the French and Indian War. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m Thomas Paine. I hear you are bound for Philadelphia, to the Continental Congress.&#x201d;<br> <br>The courier stared blankly at Paine, who seemed a tad too excited for his tastes. He said nothing, but his horse flicked its tail&#x2014;more out of habit than anything else. It was now too cold for flies&#x2014;or any other sort of insect.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, man? What is it?&#x201d; Paine demanded, drawing out each syllable so this dimwit before him might better understand his simple question.<br> <br>&#x201c;Aye,&#x201d; came the answer in a harsh Scotch-Irish brogue, &#x201c;Philadelphia.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I mean to ride with you, soldier. I need to return to my print shop. To have something printed of importance to our cause. How fast can you ride?&#x201d;<br> <br>The messenger eyed Paine with contempt. &#x201c;Fast enough for General Washington, sir,&#x201d; he answered. He was clearly annoyed by this Paine fellow, whoever he was.<br> <br>But Tom Paine didn&#x2019;t care whom he offended. He wanted his words printed&#x2014;while there was still an army to read them to.<br> <br>December 1776<br>Merrick farmhouse<br> <br>&#x201c;Any word yet from General Gates?&#x201d; General Washington asked.<br> <br>Washington had entreated Horatio Gates to join his forces, but Gates pled that he was simply too ill to travel. Like Charles Lee, he seemed strangely reluctant to meet with his commander&#x2014;or to follow simple orders.<br> <br>&#x201c;No, General,&#x201d; came a voice from the back of the room. It belonged to another general. &#x201c;But, enough of Gates. We have plenty of business before us, and I must repeat what I said yesterday: we must retreat to Philadelphia to safeguard our capital and our Congress. The very existence of our government is at stake. And besides that, we have suffered the capture of so many&#x2014;not to mention the thousands more whose enlistments have expired and have simply gone home. Two thousand from Maryland and New Jersey alone! And who knows how many more have simply deserted our cause? We must safeguard Philadelphia at all costs.&#x201d;<br> <br>Silence filled the room, which was crowded with the Continental Army&#x2019;s senior staff.<br> <br>George Washington was often slow to speak. Now, in this very crucial moment, he again paused before answering. Was he simply composing his thoughts? About to agree, or disagree with this unpalatable proposition? Or was he waiting, as he often did, for as many officers who so wanted to speak freely?<br> <br>No one said a word.<br> <br>Nathanael Greene might have been one to speak up, but his recent counsel to hold Fort Washington in upper Manhattan had proven so disastrous that he hesitated to offer any advice at that moment. It would take a while for the marvelously capable Rhode Islander to regain his confidence, so on this morning Greene merely shifted his feet and kept his gaze downward.<br> <br>A young artillery officer, Alexander Hamilton, as slight and delicate as a fifteen-year-old regimental fifer, but as hardened as any grizzled veteran of Fort Necessity, stood, arms folded, his back stiffening in barely controlled rage. But it was not for twenty-two-year-old captains to publicly upbraid generals. So he, too, kept his silence.<br> <br>The normally jovial Henry Knox&#x2019;s puffy eyes narrowed in anger. If Knox could have marshaled his 280-pound frame to crush this defeatist, he would have gladly done so right then and there. But, as even his many friends would have conceded, General Knox&#x2019;s ample body contained nary an ounce of actual muscle. Nay, if Henry Knox were to dispatch him, it would have to be by sitting upon the old faker and suffocating him.<br> <br>Knox gave the idea of retreating to Philadelphia some thought. He was about to set off his booming voice when Washington instead began to speak.<br> <br>&#x201c;General,&#x201d; Washington said, his tone measured but firm, his words addressed to his questioner, &#x201c;our soldiers take their leave because we retreat. Men enlist for victory, not humiliation. We must, even in this hour of peril&#x2014;no, particularly in this hour of gravest peril&#x2014;provide our men with the taste of victory to feed their hungry souls. And I speak not merely about the men under arms but of an entire continent of patriots.<br> <br>&#x201c;The enemy has spread his forces thin. They should be pursuing us&#x2014;building boats and bridges and moving to crush us in our weakness. But, no, instead they rest. We must not rest. We must strike. We have the boats to move back victoriously across the Delaware, just as we once ingloriously fled the other way.<br> <br>&#x201c;We must strike! Now!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, General,&#x201d; came the response of yet another general, another senior officer skilled in the art of disguising inaction in the more fashionable garments of logic and reason. &#x201c;But where would we strike? How? When? Against what units of the enemy? And what do we really know of their encampments and habits? Grand strategies must be grounded in hard intelligence&#x2014;or they are no procession toward triumphal monuments and arches, but rather to our gravestones.&#x201d;<br> <br>Washington began to ponder that point, when suddenly a hard rapping noise at the door broke the silence. A guard announced that a visitor was demanding to see General Washington at once. He could not wait, he said&#x2014;and he had to see the general alone.<br> <br>It was all highly irregular, of course, but something told Washington that he should indeed confer with this mysterious visitor.<br> <br>He abruptly broke off his council of war, letting his critics, all puffed up with fine excuses for retreat, own the last word. When all had departed, Washington sat alone, awaiting this stranger and whatever it was that he might have to convey.<br> <br>A man, rough-hewn but stout, gingerly dared to enter.<br> <br>&#x201c;You demand my time,&#x201d; Washington instantly challenged him, catching him off guard. &#x201c;State your name and purpose.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I, sir, am John Honeyman,&#x201d; the man answered in the burr of his native Scotland. &#x201c;I am a farmer from near to Trenton, and I sell my vegetables to the Hessians stationed in the town. They pay good money&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We pay in continental scrip, if you are here to peddle us your wares,&#x201d; Washington cut him off.<br> <br>&#x201c;They pay good money,&#x201d; Honeyman continued, &#x201c;but they work for our British oppressors, and I hate them. Neither gold guineas nor Spanish dollars can buy my love for them!&#x201d;<br> <br>The glint in Washington&#x2019;s eyes conveyed the pleasure he felt in those words, a secret satisfaction his ever-guarded lips dared not betray.<br> <br>Honeyman now reached his point.<br> <br>&#x201c;I sell my wares. I take my oxcart to Trenton. I see everything&#x2014;and I remember everything, sir. I can draw you a fine map. I can tell you where each man is stationed. The very position of each cannon. The hour at which their guards are changed&#x2014;that there are no fortifications. I can even tell you when their Colonel Rall arises. He is quite the late riser, you know&#x2014;or you may not know that. Such is what I have to sell to you today, General Washington.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Mr. Honeyman,&#x201d; Washington replied, as he extended a chair to this burly gift from the gods of war and fortune, &#x201c;please, take a seat.

Honor Harrington&#x2019;s Royal Manticoran Navy fights space battles alongside planetary rebels as its old rival, the corrupt Solarian League, begins to crumble.<br><br>#18 in the multiply-bestselling Honor Harrington series.<br><br>Wrong number? There are two sides to any quarrel . . . unless there are more.<br><br> Michelle Henke, Queen Elizabeth of Manticore's first cousin, Honor Harrington's best friend, and the commanding officer of Manticore's Tenth Fleet, is just a bit surprised when a messenger arrives from the Mobius System to inform her that the Mobius Liberation Front is prepared to rise in rebellion against the hated regime President Svein Lombroso. She can understand why <i>anyone</i> would want to rebel against someone like Lombroso, but why tell <i>her</i> about it? After all, she has problems of her own, like the minor matter of a life-or-death war against the Solarian League.<br><br> Michelle has just handed the "invincible" Solarian League Navy the most humiliating, one-sided defeat in its entire almost thousand-year history in defense of the people of the Star Empire's Talbott Quadrant. But the League is the most powerful star nation in the history of humanity. Its navy is going to be back &#x2013; and this time with thousands of superdreadnoughts. <br><br> Yet she also knows scores of other star systems &#x2014; some independent, some controlled by puppet regimes, and some simply conquered outright by the Solarian Office of Frontier Security &#x2014; lie in the League's grip along its frontier with the Talbott Quadrant. As combat spreads from the initial confrontation, the entire frontier has begun to seethe with unrest, and Michelle sympathizes with the oppressed populations wanting only to be free of their hated masters. <br><br> And that puts her in something of a quandary when the messenger from Mobius arrives, because someone's obviously gotten a wrong number. According to him, the Mobians&#x2019; uprising has been carefully planned to coordinate with a powerful outside ally: the Star Empire of Manticore. Only Manticore &#x2014; and Mike Henke &#x2014; have never even heard of the Mobius Liberation Front.<br><br> It's a set-up . . . and Michelle knows who's behind it. The shadowy Mesan Alignment has launched a bold move to destroy Manticore's reputation as the champion of freedom. And when the RMN <i>doesn't</i> arrive, when the MLF is brutally and bloodily crushed, no independent star system will ever trust Manticore again.<br><br> Mike Henke knows she has no orders from her government to assist <i>any</i> rebellions or liberation movements, that she has only so many ships, which can be in only so many places at a time . . . and that she can't possibly justify diverting any of her limited, outnumbered strength to missions of liberation the Star Empire never signed on for. <br><br> She knows that . . . and she doesn't care.<br><br> No one is going to send thousands of patriots to their deaths, trusting in Manticoran help that will never come. <br><br> Not on Mike Henke's watch.<br><br><b>About <i>Shadow of Freedom</i>: <br></b>&#x201c;This entry is just as exciting as Weber&#x2019;s initial offering. . . .The result is a fast-paced and action-packed story that follows [our characters] as they move from reaction to command of the situation.

In the hugely popular Honor Harrington series, the spirit of C.S. Forester&#x2019;s Horatio Hornblower and Patrick O&#x2019;Brian&#x2019;s <i>Master and Commander </i>lives on&#x2013;into the galactic future. Books in the Honor Harrington series have appeared on seventeen best seller lists, including those of <i>The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times</i>, and <i>USA Today.</i> While Weber is best known for his spirited, modern-minded space operas, he is also the creator of the Oath of Swords fantasy series and the Dahak science fiction saga. Weber has also engaged in a steady stream of bestselling collaborations, including his Starfire series with Steve White, which produced the <i>New York Times </i>bestseller <i>The Shiva Option</i> among others<i>. </i>Weber&#x2019;s collaboration with alternate history master Eric Flint led to the bestselling <i>1634: The Baltic War, </i>and his planetary adventure novels with military science fiction ace and multiple national best-seller John Ringo includes the blockbusters <i>March to the Stars </i>and<i> We Few.&nbsp;</i>Finally, Weber&#x2019;s teaming with Linda Evans produced the bestselling<i> </i>Multiverse series. David Weber makes his home in South Carolina with his wife and children.*Starred Review* Weber&#x2019;s Mission of Honor (2012) ended with several significant revelations in the Honor Harrington series, most notably a military alliance between Manticore and Haven that resulted in a resounding defeat for the invading Solarian Fleet and Core World Beowulf&#x2019;s declaration that it ally with Manticore and Haven. Eager series fans may be slightly disappointed that this installment doesn&#x2019;t immediately pick up on these developments but backs up several months to retell events from the point of view of Michelle Henke, Harrington&#x2019;s best friend and the commanding officer of the troops stationed in the Talbott Quadrant. Readers should pay close attention to the dates, as this volume covers approximately six months, four of which overlap with Mission of Honor&#x2019;s chronology. Except for in a few chapters, nearly all the action will be new to fans, including a great deal of unrest in the nearby sectors of the League, unrest that Mesan agents may be stirring up but that draws in Michelle&#x2019;s 10th Fleet. Readers intrigued by Michelle and other characters introduced in Shadow of Saganami (2004) should be thrilled that they&#x2019;re getting additional page-time and character development here. With its narrow focus on Talbott and the adjoining systems, this is a rather compact volume for Weber, but once the action gets going, readers won&#x2019;t be able to stop until the last page. Given an ending that sets up future big developments, fans will soon be clamoring for the next Honorable volume. A must for all sf collections. HIGH-DEMAND BACKSTORY: Weber is prolific and popular, and his fans constantly clamor for more. No problem, as bloggers confirm that the next volumes are already drafted. --Jessica Moyer</p><h2>The Family: A Journey into the Heart of the Twentieth Century</h2><p><b>The author of the&nbsp;<i>The Children&#x2019;s Blizzard&nbsp;</i>delivers an epic work of twentieth century history through the riveting story of one extraordinary Jewish family</b><br><br>In tracing the roots of this family&#x2014;his own family&#x2014;Laskin captures the epic sweep of the twentieth century. A modern-day scribe, Laskin honors the traditions, the lives, and the choices of his ancestors: revolutionaries and entrepreneurs, scholars and farmers, tycoons and truck drivers.&nbsp;<i>The Family</i>&nbsp;is a deeply personal, dramatic, and emotional account of people caught in a cataclysmic time in world history.<br><br>A century and a half ago, a Torah scribe and his wife raised six children in a yeshivatown at the western fringe of the Russian empire.

Unfortunately, so is this uneven compilation of essays, poems and lists that share a gardening theme. Barrett's subtle, enticing paintings capture the magic of gardens, and some writings are lovely (in the chapter "The Night Garden," Hill observes: "there is a good, round moon, whitening the flowers, making the roses . . . like pale ghostly wands, and silvering the wisteria that tumbles over the balcony"). But much is trite and overblown, such as her fantasy-garden wish list that includes a waterfall, stream and lake. And is it necessary to warn readers not to "insult" children by giving them "a neglected, weed-ridden, stone-filled patch" to garden? Like a muddled garden, this book would be improved by judicious pruning. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Obadiah the Bold</h2><p>The charming adventures of Obadiah Starbuck have been beloved by children and adults alike since he first captured hearts in the story of his friendship with an injured seagull in <i>Thy Friend, Obadiah</i>, winner of the Caldecott Honor.

Now, in this completely new version of that classic, Mr. Wagner takes into account the many dramatic changes that in recent years have revolutionized the American wine scene.<br>&nbsp;<br>With the knowledge that comes from his own experimentation, Mr. Wagner discusses the new, successful hybrids that have now made it possible to grow wine-producing grapes in far more areas of the United States than used to be considered feasible. Once again he covers all the basic technical information, including recent developments important to the small commercial winery and to the home producer&#x2014;from the choice of the right vines to the vintage itself, the care of the new wines, and finally the bottling of the wine: red, white, and ros�, sparkling and sweet.<br>&nbsp;<br>There is a new chapter on concentrates for the growing number of people who want to make wine but are not close to a source for suitable grapes, or haven&#x2019;t the space to work with fresh materials. Mr. Wagner describes what concentrates are, how they are made, what the characteristics are of different types, and what to expect. There are specific instructions on procedure and on the necessary (and unnecessary) equipment.<br>&nbsp;<br>In addition, Philip Wagner&#x2019;s introductory chapters on the evolution of the wine grape, on European winegrowing, and on the contemporary scene throughout the United States provide an excellent guide for the consumer, as does his concluding chapter on tasting and using wine. Peppered throughout with a wealth of historical and anecdotal material as well as down-to-earth experience&#x2014;and full of the author&#x2019;s appreciation of wine and winemaking as a way of life&#x2014;this book is not only a useful guide but delightful and rewarding reading.</p><p><b>PHILIP M.

Then he and his wife, Jocelyn, established a grapevine nursery and in 1945 a small commercial winery whose red, white, and ros� wines became well known, especially in the Baltimore-Washington area. Mr. Wagner served repeatedly on the wine jury of the annual California State Fair at Sacramento, where virtually all the superior wines of California were reviewed and graded, and twice as resident Regents&#x2019; Lecturer at the University of California; recently the French government has honored him by naming him an&nbsp;<i>Officier du M�rite Agricole.&nbsp;</i>His&nbsp;<i>American Wines and Wine-Making</i>&nbsp;was published in its original form in 1933, and was followed by&nbsp;<i>A Winegrower&#x2019;s Guide&nbsp;</i>in 1945.&nbsp;He died in 1997 at the age of ninety-two.</p><h2>Magnificent Vibration: A Novel</h2><p>After making an unexpected connection with God via his cell phone, one man embarks on an unlikely spiritual quest in this smart, savvy, rambunctious debut from Grammy Award-winning musician and <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Rick Springfield.<br><br><b>Why are we here?

Each year, the surf industry brings in $4.5 billion, and more than two-and-a-half million Americans, from California to Delaware, have caught the wave. Surfers have popped up on postage stamps, in television commercials, and in Hollywood movies, and the sport has developed the remarkable depth, color, and history that can only be cataloged in encyclopedic form.<br> <br>With 1,500 alphabetical entries and 300 illustrations, The Encyclopedia of Surfing is the most comprehensive review of the people, places, events, equipment, vernacular, and lively history of this fascinating sport by "one of surfing's most knowledgeable historians" (San Francisco Chronicle). A remarkable collection of expert knowledge, spine-tingling stories, and little-known trivia, this is a book that no surfer-or armchair adventurer-will be able to resist.<br><br></p><p>What's that sound coming from the beach? That's the rustle of pages turning, as would-be immortals look themselves up in <i>The Encyclopedia of Surfing</i>, surfing's first comprehensive reference book. <i>The Encyclopedia of Surfing</i> chronicles nearly every bit of wave-riding--its history, places, mythology, champions, tragedies, in-jokes, and minutiae. Author Matt Warshaw, former editor of <i>Surfer</i> magazine, and his fellow researchers took three years to put together this prodigious tome. The most surprising thing about the book is its terrific readability. Though the 1,500 entries are organized in typical encyclopedic style, one after the other alphabetically, none of them--not a <i>single one</i>--is completely boring. Not even the one on the technicalities of fin placement. In fact, the book is a trap, leading unsuspecting readers on a wandering journey from pioneer surfer Duke Kahanamoku to the development of hollow boards to the lifeguards who used them to lifeguard Eddie Aikau to his home in Waimea Bay to.... Suddenly, hours have gone by and there's still the huge entry on Gidget to read. Illustrated like a dictionary, this book has only one or two small black-and-white photos every couple of pages. A history of surfing introduces the entries; at the end, a bibliography, round-up of surf contest results, and lists of movies, magazines, and music provide the big finish. Though Warshaw's first three books (<i>SurfRiders</i>, <i>Above the Roar</i>, and <i>Maverick's</i>) were entertaining looks at surfers and surfing, this one makes him the official Kahuna of surf lore. Surfing is a multi-billion-dollar industry, flinging hordes of people and buckets of money into the waves each year. <i>The Encyclopedia of Surfing</i> is its new bible. <i>--Therese Littleton</i>Published in hardcover by Harcourt, 2003, 0-15-100579-6 <br></p><h2>The Battle of Leyte Gulf 23-26 October 1944</h2><p>Furnishes a blow-by-blow account, based on new research, of the greatest naval battle in the history of warfare, a 1944 battle that almost became a disaster for the U.S. Navy, and a sign of impending doom for the Japanese Navy.</p><p>Thomas J. Cutler is a retired lieutenant commander and former gunner's mate second class who served in patrol craft, cruisers, destroyers, and aircraft carriers. His varied assignments included an in-country Vietnam tour, small craft command, and nine years at the U.S. Naval Academy, where he served as Executive Assistant to the Chairman of the Seamanship &amp; Navigation Department and Associate Chairman of the History Department. While at the Academy, he was awarded the William P.

His television appearances include the History Channel's <i>Biography</i> series, A&amp;E's <i>Our Century</i>, Fox News Channel's <i>The O'Reilly Factor</i>, and CBS's <i>48 Hours</i>.</p>In this compelling account, retired combat veteran Cutler (Strategy/US Naval Academy; Brown Water, Black Berets, 1988) offers balanced criticism and praise of the American performance in a critical WW II battle. In October 1944, in an attempt to force a battle that would turn the tide of the war, Japanese fleets opposed General MacArthur's amphibious operations on the island of Leyte in the Philippines. Cutler shows how the American Third and Seventh fleets, which were combined to support operations on Leyte, were attacked by Japanese naval forces under Admiral Kurita; with total air superiority and a formidable attacking submarine force for which the Japanese had no counterpart, Cutler argues, the American forces should have had no difficulty achieving victory. Indeed, American air attacks in the Subuyan Sea on October 24, 1944, together with coordinated American submarine attacks, inflicted great damage on Kurita's ships. However, Admiral Ozawa, commanding a separate Japanese fleet from north of Leyte, feinted an all-out attack on American Admiral Halsey's Third Fleet, persuading Halsey that a large Japanese carrier force was attacking and diverting his fleet away from the battle. Cutler argues that if separate Japanese fleets under admirals Shima and Nishimura had been able to merge their fleets with Kurita's and coordinate their attacks, and if Kurita had not broken off the battle when a crucial task force of the Seventh Fleet was nearly exhausted, a major American defeat might have resulted. In the event, uncoordinated Japanese attacks (most notably, the destructive kamikaze attacks that were the first use of suicide fliers against American ships during the war) against an outnumbered American adversary resulted in a battle that was hugely costly on both sides, but that did not stop the American forces from achieving their strategic objectives in the Philippines. A well-researched, carefully reasoned account of the little- studied battle that made ultimate American victory in the Pacific inevitable. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

He is now considered to be one of the Woodstock Generation's most important photographers. Landy's unforgettable images have graced the covers of magazines from Rolling Stone and The Saturday Evening Post to Newsweek and Life, as well as some of the music world's most treasured albums. His photograph of a genial Bob Dylan on the Nashville Skyline album is one of the most recognizable images of the folk singer ever recorded.<p>Woodstock Dream offers a generous sampling of Landy's photos from the event and of the world that made it happen. From aerial shots of the massive, muddy crowd at Yasgur's Farm to up-close portraits of Joplin, Baez, and Havens relaxing between sets, Landy's images bring back an era that unabashedly celebrated youth and individuality, freedom and rebellion. Landy brought his camera behind the curtains of the sixties' history-making venues, such as the Fillmore East and the Newport Folk festival. He captured Rock and Roll royalty -- the Beatles, the Doors, the Stones-and the glitterati and the literati -- from Elizabeth Taylor and Lauren Bacall to Allen Ginsberg and Norman Mailer. More than just a collection of photos from an earth-shaking event, Woodstock Dream recalls the sense of spirit and commitment that swept over an entire generation, at the same time it evokes the vibrant creative energy and incredible playfulness that make the sixties seem more dreamlike than ever.</p></p><p></p><h2>CUSTER: The Controversial Life of George Armstrong Custer</h2><p>Draws on previously overlooked documents to probe the puzzles that have continued to mark the legendary general&#39;s life and career</p><p>The outlines of Custer&#39;s life are familiar to all: After graduating last in his class at West Point, he rose to become the Union&#39;s youngest general on the strength of his flamboyance and military genius. Next came 12 years of checkered service in the American West, ending with the famous massacre at Little Bighorn. The most interesting unanswered question about Custer has less to do with his history than ours--why, more than a century later, are we so captivated by the man and his story? Wert believes the answer lies in the fact that Custer is a &#34;symbol of the nation&#39;s guilt over its sad history of continental conquest.&#34;Jeffrey D.

These narrators &#x2014; including phone manufacturers in China, copper miners in Zambia, garment workers in Bangladesh, and farmers around the world &#x2014; reveal the secret history of the things we buy, including lives and communities devastated by low wages, environmental degradation, and political repression. Sweeping in scope and rich in detail, these stories capture the interconnectivity of all people struggling to support themselves and their families. Narrators include Kalpona, a leading Bangladeshi labor organizer who led her first strike at 15; Han, who, as a teenager, began assembling circuit boards for an international electronics company based in Seoul; Albert, a copper miner in Zambia who, during a wage protest, was shot by representatives of the Chinese-owned mining company that he worked for; and Sanjay, who grew up in the shadow of the Bhopal chemical disaster, one of the worst industrial accidents in history.</p><p><b>Corinne Goria</b> is a writer and lawyer.

Their common trait, aside from a laborious livelihood, is a marked desire to initiate a movement to bar unreasonable and perilous working conditions and unfair wages. Goria dramatically acknowledges the legion of overlooked workers who 'produce the things we use every day,'expressed through the carefully chosen words of crusaders who share each other&#x2019;s individual hopes and hardships.<br><br>Powerful and revealing testimony to the injustices of manual labor, infused with inspiration for global change." <i>Kirkus Reviews</i> (4/15/14 issue)<br><br>"Compiled and edited by lawyer Goria, these oral accounts of labor abuses and the struggles of the working poor cover most corners of the globalized economy. Stories from workers and labor activists in far-flung locations, including Mexico, Zambia, Bangladesh, China, and South Korea, convey a sobering uniformity of harsh working conditions, low wages, coerced labor, and ruthless retribution against unions and advocates for workers&#x2019; rights. Readers hear from Bangladeshi garment workers who struggled to get monthly minimum wages raised from $15 in 1994 to $43 by 2010; Indian farmers trapped in a cycle of borrowing, debt, and bankruptcy; and the Chinese factory worker whose journey to the electronics manufacturing hub of Shenzhen started with excitement and ended with an accident that cost him a hand. A more hopeful strain about the resilience of labor emerges in some narratives: 'Never think that you&#x2019;re less than the boss,' counsels Ana Juarez, a Mexican garment worker and activist. <b>As Kalpona Akter, a Bangladeshi labor rights advocate, says: 'It was hard for me to tell my story for this book and to make my life so public' but . . . 'if it lets another woman who has faced exploitation and repression feel that she is not alone, and even encourages her to speak up, then it is worth it.</b>'" <i>Publishers Weekly</i><br><br>"This book, edited by attorney Goria, uses oral history to introduce readers to 16 disadvantaged employees working in agriculture, the garment industry, natural resources, and electronics manufacturing in countries including India, Zambia, and the United States. These workers discuss their experiences with unsafe workplace conditions, organized labor, poor wages, and immigration. The interviews serve to educate readers about the working conditions of low-wage workers around the world and draw their attention to the challenges faced by employees toiling in less than desirable and often unsafe conditions. The book includes a time line of modern industrialization, a glossary, historical capsules providing context for the oral histories in the book, and an overview of the global decline of garment-industry wages. Readers interested in the plight of disadvantaged workers worldwide as well as the undesirable effects of globalization will be likewise interested in this book.

As a narrative of war and adventure . . . it is unsurpassable.� � Winston Churchill</p><p>This is the exciting and highly literate story of the real Lawrence of Arabia, as written by Lawrence himself, who helped unify Arab factions against the occupying Turkish army, circa World War I. Lawrence has a novelist&#39;s eye for detail, a poet&#39;s command of the language, an adventurer&#39;s heart, a soldier&#39;s great story, and his memory and intellect are at least as good as all those. Lawrence describes the famous guerrilla raids, and train bombings you know from the movie, but also tells of the Arab people and politics with great penetration. Moreover, he is witty, always aware of the ethical tightrope that the English walked in the Middle East and always willing to include himself in his own withering insight.The monumental work that assured T.E.

He wrote THE MURDER OF CAPTAIN COOK in 1979 to mark the bicentenary of the explorer&#39;s death in that year.Long before space travel and long before the proliferation of media made the world a "global village," the most dashing and courageous men in the world were such explorers as Captain James Cook. Hough's easygoing, thorough treatment of the early years of Cook's training and the later years of exploration and discovery spotlights a proud, determined man whose exploring was tightly tied to scientific speculations. Cook's meanderings introduced countless new flora and fauna and acquainted Europeans with the many cultures of the Pacific, among them the Maoris and the Hawaiians, the latter of whom dealt the explorer--literally--a death blow. (A spectacular account of Captain Cook's death at the hands of the islanders is one of the high points of the book.) Hough finishes with a flourish by suggesting that a heretofore unknown health problem may have led to the incident provoking the captain's death. The legacy of Cook, last of the great adventurers of the exploration era, is clearly indicated in his transition from exploration in search of gold and riches to modern scientific exploration. <i>Joe Collins</i></p><h2>The Balkans: Nationalism, War &amp; the Great Powers, 1804-1999</h2><p>This unique and lively history of Balkan geopolitics since the early nineteenth century gives readers the essential historical background to recent events in this war-torn area. No other book covers the entire region, or offers such profound insights into the roots of Balkan violence, or explains so vividly the origins of modern Serbia, Croatia, Bosnia, Greece, Bulgaria, Romania, and Albania. Misha Glenny presents a lucid and fair-minded account of each national group in the Balkans and its struggle for statehood. The narrative is studded with sharply observed portraits of kings, guerrillas, bandits, generals, and politicians. Glenny also explores the often-catastrophic relationship between the Balkans and the Great Powers, raising some disturbing questions about Western intervention.</p><p>The history of the Balkan states, like that of so much of the world, has for centuries been marked by ethnocidal fracases, savage wars of conquest, and periods of eerie calm. The mountainous region's shifting alliances and divisions have long puzzled outside observers, writes journalist Misha Glenny, the author of <i>The Fall of Yugoslavia</i>: "For many decades, Westerners gazed on these lands as if [they were] an ill-charted zone separating Europe's well-ordered civilization from the chaos of the Orient."<p> Those outsiders, Glenny suggests, have been the source of much of the Balkans' misery. In only the last two centuries, the territory has been contested by the Ottoman and Hapsburg empires, the Third Reich, and the Allies, all of whom exploited and exacerbated existing ethnic conflict. (The Nazi occupiers of Croatia, he writes, even had to rein in the fascist Ustase militia for fear that their campaign against Serbs and Muslims would only strengthen resistance to their puppet government.) And, he continues, attempts to quell the recent conflict in Bosnia have created problems of their own. He argues that war will break out anew the moment international troops are withdrawn and that the Dayton Agreement is too "full of anomalies and frictions" to stand. The intervention in Kosovo has been no better, he adds, and the Allies' misguided efforts are sure to yield only further bloodshed if the only objective is to remove Slobodan Milosevic from power. "Should the West fail to address the effects, not merely of a three-month air war in 1999, but of 120 years of miscalculation and indifference since the Congress of Berlin, then there will be little to distinguish NATO's actions from any of its great-power predecessors," Glenny concludes.</p><p> Glenny's provocative book sheds much light on recent Balkan history--and on the region's likely future. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>The longtime central European correspondent for the BBC World Service based in Vienna, <b>Misha Glenny</b> has lived in and worked all over the Balkans.

What exactly is food addiction? Is it possible to draw a hard line between indulging cravings for &#x201c;comfort food&#x201d; and engaging in substance abuse?

It is meant to be a knowledgeable and friendly guide on the road to food serenity.</p><p>Vera Tarman is a medical practitioner who focuses on addictions. She is the medical director of Renascent, an addictions treatment centre.

A tale of desire, regret, and sensual nostalgia, every gesture has a meaning, and even the most fleeting touch or casual utterance has the power to illuminate entire lives--sometimes in the same moment that it destroys them. Translated from the Japanese by Edward G. Seidensticker. <p><br>"A novel of exquisite artistry...rich suggestibility...and a story that is human, vivid and moving."--New York Herald Tribune </p><p>Kawabata is a poet of the gentlest shades, of the evanescent, the imperceptible. This is a tragedy in soft focus, but its passions are fierce."--Commonweal</p><b>Yasunari Kawabata</b> was born in Osaka in 1899. In 1968 he became the first Japanese writer to receive the Nobel Prize for Literature. One of Japan&#x2019;s most distinguished novelists, he published his first stories while he was still in high school, graduating from Tokyo Imperial University in 1924. His short story &#x201c;The Izu Dancer,&#x201d; first published in 1925, appeared in <i>The Atlantic Monthly</i> in 1955. Kawabata authored numerous novels, including <i>Snow Country</i> (1956), which cemented his reputation as one of the preeminent voices of his time, as well as <i>Thousand Cranes</i> (1959), <i>The Sound of the Mountain</i> (1970), <i>The Master of Go</i> (1972), and <i>Beauty and Sadness</i> (1975). He served as the chairman of the P.E.N. Club of Japan for several years and in 1959 he was awarded the Goethe-medal in Frankfurt. Kawabata died in 1972.</p><h2>Silent Cry (William Monk Novels)</h2><p>No author since Dickens has captured the shadow side of Victoria's England as masterfully as Anne Perry. In The Silent Cry, she once again exposes the particular vices spawned by an age renowned for its virtues and reforms. And our able guide is investigator William Monk, "the dark and brooding hero who infuses this luxuriantly detailed series with its romantic soul" (The New York Times Book Review).<br><br>Deep in London's filthy, dangerous slums, Victorians transacted their most secret and shameful business. For a price, a man could procure whatever he wanted, but it happened now and then that the price he paid was his life.<br><br>Now, in sunless Water Lane, respected solicitor Leighton Duff lies dead, kicked and beaten to death. Beside him lies the barely living body of his son, Rhys. The police cannot fathom these brutal assaults, until shrewd investigator William Monk uncovers a connection between them and a series of rapes and beatings of local prostitutes. Then it begins to seem shockingly clear that young Rhys Duff must have killed his own father.<br><br>In a heartstopping courtroom drama, the Crown's case against Rhys Duff, accused of patricide, begins its inexorable unfolding. With it Anne Perry adds another haunting chapter to her magnificent recreation of a bygone era.</p><p>Readers of Anne Perry's series of Victorian murder mysteries know that her novels are as much social histories as crime stories. She pens her tales with an acute eye for period detail and a strong moral outrage at the hypocrisies and miseries of life in 19th-century England. Mysteries featuring Inspector Thomas Pitt and his upper-class wife, Charlotte, explore the life of the middle class and aristocracy; those that center on William Monk illuminate the back alleys and pauper's hospitals of England's lower classes. In <i>The Silent Cry</i>, Monk and his friend Hester Latterly, an independent young woman inured to life's horrors by her nursing service during the Crimean War, investigate the murder of prostitutes in Seven Dials. As always, Perry's grim landscape of tenements, sweatshops, and boozing kens becomes almost as much a character as the living people who inhabit them, while Monk and Hester's rebellious intelligence and unconventionality keep us coming back for more.Among Anne Perry&#39;s other novels featuring investigator William Monk are Cain His Brother, Defend and Betray, and most recently Weighed in the Balance. She also writes the popular novels featuring Thomas and Charlotte Pitt, including Pentecost Alley, Traitors Gate, The Hyde Park Headsman, Highgate Rise, and Ashworth Hall, which was a Main Selection of the Book-of-the-Month Club. &#34;Her grasp of Victorian character and conscience still astonishes,&#34; said The Cleveland Plain Dealer about the author.

And it's not just the Arctic. The whole world is changing in dangerous, unpredictable ways. Sheila Watt-Cloutier has devoted her life to protecting what is threatened and nurturing what has been wounded. In this culmination of Watt-Cloutier's regional, national, and international work over the last twenty-five years,<i> The Right to Be Cold </i>explores the parallels between safeguarding the Arctic and the survival of Inuit culture, of which her own background is such an extraordinary example. This is a human story of resilience, commitment, and survival told from the unique vantage point of an Inuk woman who, in spite of many obstacles, rose from humble beginnings in the Arctic to become one of the most influential and decorated environmental, cultural, and human rights advocates in the world.</p><p><b> SHEILA WATT-CLOUTIER </b> is one of the world&#x2019;s most recognized environmental and human rights activists. Experienced in working with global decision makers for over a decade, Watt-Cloutier offers a new model for twenty-first-century leadership. She treats the issues of our day&#x2014;the environment, the economy, foreign policy, global health, and sustainability&#x2014;not as separate concerns, but as a deeply interconnected whole. In 2007, Watt-Cloutier was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize for her advocacy work in showing the impact global climate change has on human rights, especially in the Arctic, where it is felt more immediately and more dramatically than anywhere else in the world. <br><br> In addition to her Nobel nomination, Watt-Cloutier has been awarded the Aboriginal Achievement Award, the UN Champion of the Earth Award, and the prestigious Norwegian Sophie Prize. She is also an officer of the Order of Canada. From 1995 to 2002, she served as the elected Canadian president of the Inuit Circumpolar Council (ICC). In 2002, she was elected international chair of the council. Under her leadership, the world&#x2019;s first international legal action on climate change was launched with a petition to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights.The world I was born into has changed forever.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For the first ten years of my life, I travelled only by dog team. As the youngest child of four on our family hunting and ice fishing trips, I would be snuggled into warm blankets and fur in a box tied safely on top of the <i>qamutiik</i>, the dogsled. I would view the vast expanses of Arctic sky and feel the crunching of the snow and the ice below me as our dogs, led by my brothers, Charlie and Elijah, carried us safely across the frozen land. I remember just as vividly the Arctic summer scenes that slipped by as I sat in the canoe on the way to our hunting and fishing grounds.The world was blue and white and rocky, and defined by the things that had an immediate bearing on us&#x2014;the people who helped and cared for us, the dogs that gave us their strength, the water and land that nurtured us. The Arctic may seem cold and dark to those who don&#x2019;t know it well, but for us a day of hunting or fishing brought the most succulent, nutritious food. Then there would be the intense joy as we gathered together as family and friends, sharing and partaking of the same animal in a communal meal. To live in a boundless&nbsp;landscape and a close-knit culture in which everything matters and everything is connected is a kind of magic. Like generations of Inuit, I bonded with the ice and snow.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Those idyllic moments of my childhood seem very far away these days. Today, while dog teams, <i>qajaq</i>s (kayaks) and canoes are at times still used to move out onto the Arctic land and water, snow machines are more common than dogs, and the hum of fast-moving powerboats is now heard on Arctic waters. All of our communities now have airports, medical clinics and schools, with some having hospitals, television stations, daycares and colleges. Our people still hunt and fish, sew and bead, but they are also nurses, lawyers, teachers, business people and politicians. The Arctic is a different place than it was when I was a child. And while many of the changes are positive, the journey into the modern world was not an easy one&#x2014;and it has left its scars.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In a sense, Inuit of my generation have lived in both the ice age and the space age. The modern world arrived slowly in some places in the world, and quickly in others. But in the Arctic, it appeared in a single generation. Like everyone I grew up with, I have seen ancient traditions give way to southern habits. I have seen communities broken apart or transformed dramatically by government policies. I have seen Inuit traditional wisdom supplanted by southern programs and institutions. And most shockingly, like all my fellow Inuit, I have seen what seemed permanent begin to melt away.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Arctic ice and snow, the frozen terrain that Inuit life has depended on for millennia, is now diminishing in front of our eyes.</p><h2>The Judas Judge (Kevin Kerney Novels)</h2><p>A vicious multiple murder and the shooting of a crooked police officer draw Sheriff Kevin Kerney, a former Santa Fe police detective, into a baffling and dangerous investigation into police corruption extending to the highest levels of state government. By the author of Tularosa. 30,000 first printing.</p><p>A new Kevin Kerney mystery is a bright spot in any publishing season, and in McGarrity's fifth book in the series, he brings Kerney back home to southern New Mexico on the trail of a spree killer who's murdered six victims at remote campgrounds. But something in the crime pattern tells Kerney these murders aren't as random as they first appear. Instead, they seem to be senseless killings meant to cover up the last one, a very personal crime involving family secrets hidden for generations. It's supposed to be the last case for Kerney, whose unexpected inheritance of a vast tract of prime ranchland and recent marriage to a career army officer (<i>Hermit's Peak</i>, <i>Serpent Gate</i>) have him putting in for early retirement from the police force. And it's all mixed up with a stalker seeking revenge on Kerney for his part in an Internal Affairs investigation that got a cop kicked off the force and led to a deadly gunfight that still haunts Kerney. <p> This is a solid bull's-eye for McGarrity. It leaves the reader hungry for his next, in which presumably Kerney will rethink his retirement plans as he copes with impending fatherhood and the kind of financial freedom most lawmen never experience. What makes this series work is not only its likable hero but also the brilliant evocation of the American Southwest he calls home. <i>--Jane Adams</i></p>Michael McGarrity is the author of the Anthony Award--nominated novel <i>Tularosa</i>, as well as <i>Mexican Hat</i>, <i>Serpent Gate</i>, and <i>Hermit's Peak</i>.

It's a trio of tales steeped in the atmosphere of the Pacific Northwest that is sure to remind everyone that Jance is a master of modern suspense fiction.</p><p>In <strong>Until Proven Guilty</strong> Beaumont finds himself investigating the murder of a five-year-old girl. But his own obsessions and demons could prove dangerous companions in a murky world of blind faith and religious fanaticism as he discovers that he himself is the target of a twisted passion ... and a love that can kill. In <strong>Injustice for All</strong> Beaumont's well-earned vacation becomes a waking nightmare as he's forced to comfort a beautiful blonde after she discovers a dead body on a Washington beach. Suddenly a lethal brew of lust, madness, and politics threatens to drag the dedicated Seattle cop into the path of a killer whose dark hunger is rapidly becoming an obsession. And in <strong>Trial by Fury</strong> a naked, dead body is found lying in a Dumpster. What's most shocking is the manner in which the man died -- he was lynched. The victim, a high school coach, has left behind a very pregnant wife with a very dangerous secret. And a sixth sense developed over twenty years on the job tells Beaumont that this investigation is going to the lethal extremes of passion, lies, and hatred.</p></p><p><p>J. A.

The author of Tarzan of the Apes (1912), Burroughs did not confine himself to a single genre; he also wrote medieval romances (The Outlaw of Torn, 1914), westerns (The Wur Chief of the Apaches, 1927), and mainstream novels (The Girl from Hollywood, 1922).<b> <b>FOREWORD</b> <br> <b>TO THE READER OF THIS WORK:</b> </b> <br> <br>In submitting Captain Carter&#x2019;s strange manuscript to you in book form, I believe that a few words relative to this remarkable personality will be of interest.<br> <br>My first recollection of Captain Carter is of the few months he spent at my father&#x2019;s home in Virginia, just prior to the opening of the Civil War. I was then a child of but five years, yet I will remember the tall, dark, smooth-faced, athletic man whom I called Uncle Jack.<br> <br>He seemed always to be laughing; and he entered into the sports of the children with the same hearty good fellowship he displayed toward those pastimes in which the men and women of his own age indulged; or he would sit for an hour at a time entertaining my old grandmother with stories of his strange, wild life in all parts of the world. We all loved him, and our slaves fairly worshipped the ground he trod.<br> <br>He was a splendid specimen of manhood, standing a good two inches over six feet, broad of shoulder and narrow of hip, with the carriage of the trained fighting man. His features were regular and clear cut, his hair black and closely cropped, while his eyes were of a steel gray, reflecting a strong and loyal character, filled with fire and initiative. His manners were perfect, and his courtliness was that of a typical southern gentleman of the highest type.<br> <br>His horsemanship, especially after hounds, was a marvel and delight even in that country of magnificent horsemen. I have often heard my father caution him against his wild recklessness but he would only laugh, and say that the tumble that killed him would be from the back of a horse yet unfoaled.<br> <br>When the war broke out he left us, nor did I see him again for some fifteen or sixteen years. When he returned it was without warning, and I was much surprised to note that he had not aged apparently a moment, nor had he changed in any other outward way. He was, when others were with him, the same genial, happy fellow we had known of old, but when he thought himself alone I have seen him sit for hours gazing off into space, his face set in a look of wistful longing and hopeless misery; and at night he would sit thus looking up into the heavens, at what I did not know until I read his manuscript years afterwards.<br> <br>He told us that he had been prospecting and mining in Arizona part of the time since the war; and that he had been very successful was evidenced by the unlimited amount of money with which he was supplied. As to the details of his life during these years he was very reticent, in fact he would not talk of them at all.<br> <br>He remained with us for about a year and then went to New York, where he purchased a little place on the Hudson, where I visited him once a year on the occasions of my trips to the New York market&#x2014;my father and I owning and operating a string of general stores throughout Virginia at that time. Captain Carter had a small but beautiful cottage, situated on a bluff overlooking the river, and during one of my last visits, in the winter of 1885, I observed he was much occupied in writing, I presume now, upon this manuscript.<br> <br>He told me at this time that if anything should happen to him he wished me to take charge of his estate, and he gave me a key to a compartment in the safe which stood in his study, telling me I would find his will there and some personal instructions which he had me pledge myself to carry out with absolute fidelity.<br> <br>After I had retired for the night I have seen him from my window standing in the moonlight on the brink of the bluff overlooking the Hudson with his arms stretched out to the heavens as though in appeal. I thought at the time that he was praying, although I never had understood that he was in the strict sense of the term a religious man.<br> <br>Several months after I had returned home from my last visit, the first of March, 1886, I think, I received a telegram from him asking me to come to him at once. I had always been his favorite among the younger generation of Carters and so I hastened to comply with his demand.<br> <br>I arrived at the little station, about a mile from his grounds, on the morning of March 4, 1886, and when I asked the livery man to drive me out to Captain Carter&#x2019;s he replied that if I was a friend of the Captain&#x2019;s he had some very bad news for me; the Captain had been found dead shortly after daylight that very morning by the watchman attached to an adjoining property.<br> <br>For some reason this news did not surprise me, but I hurried out to his place as quickly as possible, so that I could take charge of the body and of his affairs.<br> <br>I found the watchman who had discovered him, together with the local police chief and several townspeople, assembled in his little study. The watchman related the few details connected with the finding of the body, which he said had been still warm when he came upon it. It lay, he said, stretched full length in the snow with the arms outstretched above the head toward the edge of the bluff, and when he showed me the spot it flashed upon me that it was the identical one where I had seen him on those other nights, with his arms raised in supplication to the skies.<br> <br>There were no marks of violence on the body, and with the aid of a local physician the coroner&#x2019;s jury quickly reached a decision of death from heart failure. Left alone in the study, I opened the safe and withdrew the contents of the drawer in which he had told me I would find my instructions. They were in part peculiar indeed, but I have followed them to each last detail as faithfully as I was able.<br> <br>He directed that I remove his body to Virginia without embalming, and that he be laid in an open coffin within a tomb which he previously had had constructed and which, as I later learned, was well ventilated. The instructions impressed upon me that I must personally see that this was carried out just as he directed, even in secrecy if necessary.<br> <br>His property was left in such a way that I was to receive the entire income for twenty-five years, when the principal was to become mine. His further instructions related to this manuscript which I was to retain sealed and unread, just as I found it, for eleven years; nor was I to divulge its contents until twenty-one years after his death.<br> <br>A strange feature about the tomb, where his body still lies, is that the massive door is equipped with a single, huge gold-plated spring lock which can be opened <i>only from the inside</i>.<br> <br>Yours very sincerely,<br> <br>Edgar Rice Burroughs<br> <br>� 2012 Simon &amp; Schuster</p><h2>Eyes on the Street: The Life of Jane Jacobs</h2><p><b>The first major biography of the irrepressible woman who changed the way we view and live in cities, and whose influence can still be felt in any discussion of urban planning to this day.</b> <br><br><i>Eyes on the Street</i> is a revelation of the phenomenal woman who raised three children, wrote seven groundbreaking books, saved neighborhoods, stopped expressways, was arrested twice, and engaged at home and on the streets in thousands of debates--all of which she won. Here is the child who challenged her third-grade teacher; the high school poet; the journalist who honed her writing skills at <i>Iron Age</i>, <i>Architectural Forum</i>, <i>Fortune</i>, and other outlets, while amassing the knowledge she would draw upon to write her most famous book, <i>The Death and Life of Great American Cities</i>. Here, too, is the activist who helped lead an ultimately successful protest against Robert Moses's proposed expressway through her beloved Greenwich Village; and who, in order to keep her sons out of the Vietnam War, moved to Canada, where she became as well known and admired as she was in the United States.</p><p><b>ROBERT KANIGEL</b> is the author of seven previous books.

The fur district she&#x2019;d stumbled upon so fortuitously was in Manhattan. So was the diamond district.&nbsp;<i>Vogue&nbsp;</i>itself, New York fashion personified, was in Manhattan. The jobs she got that first year were all in Manhattan, as were the better jobs she sought now. So were Broadway, Times Square, Fifth Avenue, the tall towers, the publishing houses, the galleries, and practically all the other iconic places of New York. It was hard not to feel the pull. Jane had only to glance down Henry Street, at the great stone arches that were the Brooklyn Bridge approaches, to take herself in her mind&#x2019;s eye to Manhattan. For Jane, as for any young person of curiosity and spunk, the city beckoned.<br><br>On one of her forays into Manhattan near the end of that first year, probably in late summer, Jane got out at the Christopher Street subway stop; she &#x201c;liked the sound of the name,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d say. She had no idea where she was, &#x201c;but I was enchanted with this place . . . I spent the rest of the afternoon just walking these streets.&#x201d;<br><br>As she got off the train, she&#x2019;d have seen the name of the station set in mosaic tile, as in most of New York&#x2019;s four hundred&#x2013;odd subway stations:<br>&nbsp;<br>CHRISTOPHER ST. <br>SHERIDAN SQ.<br>&nbsp;<br>Sheridan Square was no &#x201c;square&#x201d; at all, of course. But out of its irregu- lar and unlovely expanse radiated Seventh Avenue South and wide West Fourth Street. Stroll along them, or on Grove Street, Washington Place, or Waverly Place, which all converged there, and soon you found your- self among a warren of little streets south and west of the square, the clubs and bars lining West Fourth Street that drew revelers from the outer boroughs, art galleries, small shops, modest apartment buildings. <br><br>It was here, in a low-lying bowl of cityscape mostly off the tourist maps, far from the great employment centers, not grand, not rich, maybe a little ragtag, that Jane now found herself. No neatly defined shopping districts here in the streets near Sheridan Square, nothing like upscale Fifth Avenue or proletarian Fourteenth Street&#x2014;no neatly defined any- thing. Blocks of handsome brownstones across Sixth Avenue that could have stepped out of a Henry James novel, musical Italian filling the shops and stoops of the tenements to the south, gritty warehouses and a sprin- kling of small-scale industry to the west. Along Bleecker Street, a bakery selling Italian bread for a nickel a loaf, a cheese shop selling ricotta for twenty-five cents a pound. Peasant smocks, antique jewelry, and second- hand books for sale arrayed on one block. A drugstore selling cosmetics and contraceptives. An ice cream parlor where the neighborhood&#x2019;s young Italian men hung out. The scale was small, the range and variety stun- ning, the streetscape obeying nothing like cool Cartesian order. This wasn&#x2019;t New York in its bigness, its numbers, its densest crowds that Jane found here. If anything, it was New York in all its smallness, its irregular- ity, its turn-the-corner-and-what-do-you-find little shocks and surprises. <br><br>The Manhattan street grid fell apart here, as if by an abrupt, invasive fault in an otherwise orderly crystal matrix. West Fourth Street, obediently grid-bound just to the east, at Sheridan Square abruptly veered northwest and, after a few blocks, dared to run, against all sense and logic, into West Eleventh Street. Other streets, like Carmine, Cornelia, and Jones, simply disappeared after a block or two. A conscientious student of urban life, Professor Caroline Ware of Vassar College, had recently tallied the &#x201c;contents&#x201d; of one block of Jones Street. She counted old-law tenements and 1840s-vintage houses, an apartment house that went up only in 1929, factories that made feather mattresses, children&#x2019;s toys, and Italian ice cream; an old stable, a settlement house, two grocers, a tobacco and candy store, an ice dealer&#x2019;s cellar, a French hand laundry, a barber shop, a tea room, an &#x201c;Italian men&#x2019;s caf�,&#x201d; a wrought iron workshop, and (it still being Prohibition at the time of her census) three speakeasies. All in a single block. Behind this line of five-story fa�ades&#x2014;inside, unseen, hidden&#x2014;life played out each day and night, in all its struggles, pains, and pleasures; on the busy sidewalks outside, traces and whispers only of those silent stories, spilling out into the city&#x2019;s everyday jangle.<br>Spend an afternoon on streets like Jones Street, as Jane did, and any part of the brain habituated to easy order was bound to come away bruised. But Jane? She &#x201c;liked the little streets,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d remember. &#x201c;I liked the variety of it and there were craft shops of hand-made things of inge- nuity and artistry. I had never seen shops like those. I just thought it was great.&#x201d; The whole neighborhood was great. Could she have said why, exactly? Maybe not. She was nineteen. She was all enthusiasm.</p><h2>Judith Roy Ross: Photographs</h2><p>Judith Joy Ross has, over the past 30 years, come up with a very idiosyncratic view of average American daily life. In her hometown of Hazleton, Pennsylvania, she took pictures of schoolchildren in all the schools she had attended herself, creating a series of sensitive portraits that says a great deal about growing up, about equal opportunities that are equal in name only, and about life in the American heartland. Ross caused a stir in the 1990s with portraits she took in front of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington. The emotional breadth of responses on the faces of the anonymous visitors is stunning. Ross works using a plate camera, taking exclusively black and white pictures in the tradition of artists such as August Sander or Walker Evans, with his &#x201c;documentary style&#x201d;. This book presents Ross&#x2019; award-winning oeuvre comprehensively for the first time.<br><br></p><p></p><h2>Alternative Medicine: The Definitive Guide</h2><p>This encyclopedia puts all the schools of alternative medicine under one roof. The Guide is packed with lifesaving information and alternative treatments from 380 of the world&#39;s leading physicians. Over 200 serious health conditions--from cancer to obesity, heart desease to PMS--are covered. This book also gives you dozens of actual patient stories and physician treatments to show you how this medicine really works.</p><p><i>The Definitive Guide</i> is known as the Bible of alternative medicine. You may very well want to use a dictionary stand for this hefty tome; it weighs in at more than 1,000 pages. Nearly 400 doctors (M.D.s, Ph.D.s, naturopaths, Doctors of Oriental Medicine, and osteopaths) contribute their cutting-edge knowledge, and the list of names is impressive. You'll find words of advice from Joseph Pizzorno, the president of Bastyr University in Seattle, Washington; C. Norman Shealy, the cofounder of the American Holistic Medical Association; Nobel laureate Linus Pauling; Deepak Chopra; and Joan Borysenko, author and director of the Mind-Body Health Sciences in Boulder, Colorado. <p>After an intriguing, optimistic look at "The Future of Medicine," the book is divided into two sections. The first profiles 43 alternative therapies--acupuncture, craniosacral therapy, qigong, hyperthermia, and yoga among them--including their development, how they work, proven uses, and controversial or yet-to-be-proven uses, along with contact information for organizations. The second section covers 105 topics such as headaches, mental health, and allergies, along with the alternative therapies that are most likely to help alleviate pain and encourage healing. This guide is easy enough to understand to make it perfect for home reference, while it would also make a fine resource for health care providers interesting in learning more about alternative medicine. <i>--Erica Jorgensen</i></p></p><h2>In the Name of Gucci: A Memoir</h2><p><b>The gripping family drama</b>&#x2014;<b>and never-before-told love story</b>&#x2014;<b>surrounding the rise and fall of the late Aldo Gucci, the man responsible for making the legendary fashion label the powerhouse it is today, as told by his daughter.</b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> Patricia Gucci was born a secret: the lovechild whose birth could have spelled ruination for her father, Aldo Gucci. It was the early 1960s, the halcyon days for Gucci<i>&#x2014;</i>the must-have brand of Hollywood and royalty<i>&#x2014;</i>but also a time when having a child out of wedlock was illegal in Italy. Aldo couldn't afford a public scandal, nor could he resist his feelings for Patricia&#x2019;s mother, Bruna, the paramour he met when she worked in the first Gucci store in Rome. To avoid controversy, he sent Bruna to London after she became pregnant, and then discretely whisked her back to Rome with her newborn hidden from the Italian authorities, the media, and the Gucci family. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>In the Name of Gucci</i> charts the untold love story of Patricia&#x2019;s parents, relying on the author&#x2019;s own memories, a collection of love letters and interviews with her mother, as well as an archive of previously unseen photos. She interweaves her parents' tempestuous narrative with that of her own relationship with her father&#x2014;from an isolated little girl who lived in the shadows for the best part of a decade through her rise as Gucci's spokesperson and Aldo's youngest prot�g�, to the moment when Aldo&#x2019;s three sons were shunned after betraying him in a notorious coup and Patricia&#x2014;once considered a guilty secret&#x2014;was made his sole universal heir. It is an epic tale of love and loss, treason and loyalty, sweeping across Italy, England and America during the most tumultuous period of Gucci's sixty years as a family business.</p><p>PATRICIA GUCCI was born in London and educated in England, Italy, and Switzerland before moving to New York to study acting. In 1982 she was appointed to the board of Gucci and roving ambassador in the United States and Asia until the company&#39;s sale to Investcorp in 1987.

My marriage was crumbling, I had a new baby, and it fell to me to deal with the lawyers for my father&#x2019;s estate. There was no time to grieve. Unable to guide my mother, I was powerless as she struggled to accept the loss that, for a while, rendered her completely incoherent.&nbsp;</p><p>Her helplessness effectively shut down all channels of communication between us at a time when I needed her most. For the next few years we hardly connected at all. By the time I was in my forties I was counting the cost of two failed marriages and the toll they had taken on my three daughters. For reasons I hadn&#x2019;t yet understood, I seemed to attract the wrong kind of man and suffered immensely as a result. True love--the kind my parents shared during their long and complex relationship--had eluded me.</p><p>Thankfully, I had some wonderful friends, but they could only support me so much. Prayer and meditation helped, but I realized that part of the problem was that I didn&#x2019;t feel grounded. I had never met my grandparents and I barely knew my brothers. I had only really come to know my father properly in the last phase of his life, and my mother remained a mystery to me. The more I delved into my own psyche, I began to appreciate that my misguided choices seemed to stem from my fractured childhood and dysfunctional family relationships. In order to move forward, I needed to go back to my roots and reconcile with my past.</p><p>Eventually, it occurred to me that it might help to write a book about my father. I wanted to chronicle our lives with him as we experienced it--as a record for my family. I hoped to give my children a unique and truthful memento, not one sensationalized by others. Most important, I believed that he deserved his rightful place in history, not only for his role in establishing Gucci but as a pioneer of the iconic &#x201c;Made in Italy&#x201d; label throughout the world.</p><p>What I didn&#x2019;t expect was that my research would lead me back to my mother. After years of estrangement, I could finally begin to understand their unique bond and give her the credit she deserved.</p><p>My epiphany began in 2009 when I visited her in Rome. After a lamentable lapse of six months interspersed only with twice-weekly telephone calls, I sat with her and began to talk. Hoping to learn from her own long journey of self-discovery, I spoke about my experiences of the previous few months, including my travels and visits to spiritual retreats. She understood that I was still trying to find myself.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve met many interesting people and a few of them have made me realize just how many blanks there are in my childhood memories,&#x201d; I told her, treading softly. &#x201c;In fact, there&#x2019;s just one big black hole. I appreciate that I never asked, but I know so little about you and Papa and your life when you were younger and I&#x2019;d love to know more.&#x201d;</p><p>I could tell from my mother&#x2019;s body language that she was uncomfortable with the direction I was going in and would rather not speak about such matters. Every time I&#x2019;d tried in the past, she&#x2019;d pushed me away, saying that she didn&#x2019;t remember or--more tellingly--that she didn&#x2019;t want to. Her habit of bottling things up, never explaining anything, and keeping me in the dark was a pattern that had been repeated my entire life, so I feared that nothing much would change.</p><p>Sure enough, after looking askance at me she shrugged her shoulders and asked, &#x201c;What good will it do after all this time?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, I thought opening up might help you too,&#x201d; I replied. &#x201c;I know that you&#x2019;ve never felt understood.&#x201d;</p><p>She looked at me for a moment in silence. When she stood abruptly and went to her bedroom I thought I&#x2019;d gone too far and that our conversation was over. But something I said that day must have resonated, because she returned with a leather pouch bearing the distinctive Gucci insignia. Handing it to me, she said, &#x201c;Your father wrote me many letters. I kept them all. Here, I want to give them to you.&#x201d;</p><p>Until that moment in that sun-filled apartment, I had no idea that Papa had penned a single note to my mother. He lived his life at a gallop and I couldn&#x2019;t imagine when he&#x2019;d have had time to write her so many lettere d&#x2019;amore.</p><p>Wisely, I held my tongue, unzipped the pouch, and pulled out a bundle of letters, some on blue airmail paper, some on hotel stationery, some typed or written in my father&#x2019;s distinctive hand, all of them in Italian. The treasured archive of their courtship years between 1958 and 1961 was interspersed with telegrams from overseas. Why had she kept these for over fifty years?</p><p>Quickly flicking through them, my eyes settled on a sentence--&#x201c;My treasure, my love, don&#x2019;t leave me! Do not destroy the very best part of my life . . . do not push me away; this feeling is not just infatuation but a vast and boundless love.&#x201d;</p><p>I could hardly believe what I was reading. My mother watched me for a moment as I sifted through them and then she rose to make some tea. &#x201c;They are such beautiful letters,&#x201d; she said softly from the doorway. &#x201c;Your father had a wonderful way with words. It was one of the things that first attracted me to him.&#x201d;&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Will you read them with me?&#x201d; I asked, but she raised her hand and shook her head.</p><p>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t. I remember how they made me feel all those years ago. That is enough.&#x201d;</p><p>My eyes filling with tears, I realized she had just handed me a priceless legacy. Two decades after his death, she&#x2019;d opened a window to their secret life together--my first glimpse into what had been a mystery for so long.</p><p>&#x201c;But these are incredible, Mamma!&#x201d; I exclaimed.&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; she added. &#x201c;It was a kind of fiaba [fairy tale]--but not necessarily one with a happy ending.&#x201d;</p><p>Her gift marked the start of my quest to piece together the jigsaw of my parents&#x2019; lives, and ultimately of my own. My father&#x2019;s words sparked a thousand questions, many of which she agreed to answer over the next few years. Subsequent research took me on an intriguing journey back to my Florentine and Roman origins, which has enlightened me on many levels.</p><p>So much has been written about the &#x201c;saga&#x201d; of the House of Gucci, with far too much emphasis given to my father&#x2019;s fall from grace and the bitter family relationships that led to scandal, divorce, and even murder. So little has been said about what a great man he was or how much he loved my mother.&nbsp;</p><p>Through the power of his words, I discovered him as a passionate and sensitive person, in sharp contrast with his public reputation as the ruthless chairman who ruled with an iron fist. Mostly, I gained a whole new perspective on the unorthodox love story between my parents in the golden age of la dolce vita. This has been a deeply insightful experience for me after a somewhat scattered childhood. I have come to appreciate not only my father&#x2019;s trials and tribulations but also the sacrifices my mother made as a young woman destined to become the mistress and lifelong companion of an unsung hero of modern Italy.</p><p>In the course of my pilgrimage, she has finally felt able to open up and show me the unseen Aldo Gucci--glimpses of whom I witnessed for myself only at the end of his life. &#x201c;There was another side to him,&#x201d; she insists. &#x201c;A side that only I knew. That was the real Aldo.&#x201d;</p><p>And in revealing him to me, she has allowed me to see her through his eyes for the first time.</p></p><h2>Attaching in Adoption: Practical Tools for Today&#39;s Parents</h2><p>All parents deserve positive, proactive, and state-of-the-art knowledge about their children. This is all the more imperative when children have been adopted after challenges. Parents want practical guidance during their child&#39;s formative years. No parent wants to face a tragic outcome later! This book provides adoptive parents with specific information that applies to children like theirs. It matches children&#39;s emotional needs and stages with parenting strategies designed to enhance their child&#39;s happiness and emotional health . The stages have been adapted for parents whose child who might be emotionally a toddler at age six. This book gives parents techniques and information so they can provide their children with a home life designed to bring out the best in every family member. Methods to improve attachment, respect, cooperation, trust, and caring in the family are constant themes in this book.</p><p>Proper attachment is the most fundamental issue in a successful adoption, but what exactly does the term mean? <i>Attaching in Adoption</i> answers that question thoroughly, and it provides solutions to a variety of specific attachment problems.<p> Along with technical explanations of challenges such as self-esteem, childhood grief, and limit-testing, the book includes a tremendous number of personal vignettes illustrating attachment-related situations. Parents who are convinced that only their child has ever behaved a certain way are sure to take comfort in these stories; not only do they include kids from all backgrounds and age groups, but each has an ultimately happy ending. The emotional health of the whole family is also paramount according to the book--with plenty of rest and "alone time," caregivers are more likely to be emotionally available when they are most needed. </p><p> Because <i>Attaching in Adoption</i> focuses on special needs, families who are coming together through foster programs, at later ages, or across cultural lines will find it especially helpful. Both psychologically detailed and straightforwardly helpful, it can be of equal benefit to counselors and parents alike. <i>--Jill Lightner</i></p>Gray, a clinical social worker specializing in attachment, grief and trauma, has penned a comprehensive guidebook for adoptive parents, taking an in-depth look at how children and families adjust. The author notes that many of today's adoptions involve older children who may have been abused or neglected, or who may have spent years in institutions or various foster situations; due to their past experiences these children may have difficulty attaching to their adoptive parents. Explaining that attachment forms the template for future adult relationships, Gray stresses how important it is for adoptive parents to be patient in forging this new bond. She advises creating a high structure/ high nurture environment for the child, and instructs parents to find out about their child's background. The book covers many issues, including cross-cultural and interracial adoption, religious concerns and other complications for attaching, such as ADHD and learning disabilities. Gray also includes a detailed exploration of developmental delays common in kids who have been adopted later in life. While the book is densely written, it will nevertheless be invaluable for adoptive parents. Gray compassionately helps readers form realistic expectations, while offering a myriad of suggestions for families and children striving to form lasting, loving relationships. <br>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Hello from Heaven! A New Field of Research After-Death Communication Confirms That Life and Love Are Eternal</h2><p>Hello From Heaven! is the first complete study of an exciting new field of research called After-Death Communication, or ADC. This is a spiritual experience that occurs when someone is contacted spontaneously and directly by a family member or friend who has died. ADC experiences are always initiated by deceased loved ones, without the use of psychics, mediums, or devices. They include sensing a presence, hearing a voice, feeling a touch, smelling a fragrance, seeing a partial or full appearance, visions, twilight encounters, sleep-state meetings, out-of-body contacts, telephone conversations, physical phenomena, and receiving signs.<br>During their seven years of research, the authors interviewed 2,000 people from all walks of life and many religious backgrounds in the United States and Canada. Through comprehensive interviews, they collected more than 3,300 firsthand accounts from people who believe they have been contacted by a loved one who has died.<br>The authors focus on the twelve major types of after-death communication people report, the messages they receive, and the effects on the experiencers' lives. They present persuasive evidence that ADCs are authentic contacts by deceased relatives and friends and discuss some of the far-reaching implications of their research.</p><p>Bill Guggenheim and Judy Guggenheim interviewed more than 2,000 people to find firsthand accounts that met their strict criteria for spontaneous after-death communication (ADC). <i>Hello from Heaven!</i> is a trove of this firsthand data, but the Guggenheims' interpretations of it are what reveal the impact that such radical experiences have on the living. It's a scientific look at ADC for the curious or the skeptic and an inspirational work for anyone seeking comfort in the wake of a loved one's departure.death communications," or "ADCs, " occur when someone is contacted <i>spontaneously</i> and <i>directly</i> by a deceased family member or friend, without the help of any medium.

Yet, as Andr�s Res�ndez illuminates in his myth-shattering <i>The Other Slavery</i>, it was practiced for centuries as an open secret. There was no abolitionist movement to protect the tens of thousands of natives who were kidnapped and enslaved by the conquistadors, then forced to descend into the &#x201c;mouth of hell&#x201d; of eighteenth-century silver mines or, later, made to serve as domestics for Mormon settlers and rich Anglos. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;Res�ndez builds the incisive case that it was mass slavery, more than epidemics, that decimated Indian populations across North America. New evidence, including testimonies of courageous priests, rapacious merchants, Indian captives, and Anglo colonists, sheds light too on Indian enslavement of other Indians &#x2014; as what started as a European business passed into the hands of indigenous operators and spread like wildfire across vast tracts of the American Southwest.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><i>The Other Slavery</i> reveals nothing less than a key missing piece of American history. &nbsp;For over two centuries we have fought over, abolished, and tried to come to grips with African-American slavery. &nbsp;It is time for the West to confront an entirely separate, equally devastating enslavement we have long failed truly to see.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Praise for <i>The Other Slavery</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Every now and then a new book comes along that throws a switch on our historical valences and makes us see ourselves anew. <i>The Other Slavery</i> is one such book. Much as&nbsp;<i>Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee</i> did when it first appeared in the early 1970s, Andr�s Res�ndez&#x2019;s carefully sifted work fundamentally reshapes our understanding of a great enduring mystery: What really accounts for the swift and tragic demise of our continent&#x2019;s indigenous peoples?&#x201d;&#x2014;Hampton Sides, author of <i>Blood and Thunder</i> and<i> In the Kingdom of Ice</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;In&nbsp;<i>The Other Slavery</i>&nbsp;Andr�s Res�ndez&nbsp;retells a vast section of Native American and North American history by putting forced labor in its multiple forms at the center.

Hopper (1882-1967) gravitated to painting lunch counters, nudes in hotel rooms, lighthouses, gas stations, rooftops--underappreciated, nakedly honest figurations of America's heartland. A prophet of loneliness, this laconic individualist captured the anarchy of American cities, the quiet melancholy of small towns and suburbs. Paradoxically, his pictures have a restorative, bracing effect--perhaps, as is suggested here, because of Hopper's emotional attachment to his native environment. The late Goodrich was director of the Whitney Museum in New York and a friend of the artist, whose own comments are interspersed with a refreshingly readable text and more than 200 full-page plates. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Algebra</h2><p>Printed in Asia - Carries Same Contents as of US edition - Opt Expedited Shipping for 3 to 4 day delivery -</p><p></p><h2>The Sinister Mystery of the Mesmerizing Girl (3) (The Extraordinary Adventures of the Athena Club)</h2><p><b>Mary Jekyll and the Athena Club race to save Alice&#x2014;and foil a plot to unseat the Queen, in the electrifying conclusion to the trilogy that began with the Nebula Award finalist and Locus Award winner <i>The Strange Case of the Alchemist&#x2019;s Daughter</i>.</b><br><br>Life&#x2019;s always an adventure for the Athena Club...especially when one of their own has been kidnapped!

The publication after nineteen years of An Unsuitable Attachment therefore became an important literary event and a source of joy for her many fans. Set in St Basil`s, an undistinguished North London parish, An Unsuitable Attachment is indeed full of the high comedy for which she is famed. There is Mark Ainger, the vicar, who introduces his sermons with remarks like `Those of you who are familiar with the church of Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome. ` His wife Sophia with her cat, `I feel sometimes that I can`t reach Faustina as I`ve reached other cats. ` Rupert Stonebird, anthropologist and eligible bachelor. The well-bred Ianthe Broome who works at the library and forms an unsuitable attachment with a young man there. The sharp-tongue Mervyn Cantrell, chief librarian, who complains that `when books have things spilt on them it is always bottled sauce or gravy of the thickest and most repellent kind rather than something utterly exquisite and delicious. ` There is also Daisy Pettigrew, the vet`s sister, another obsessional cat person, and Sister Dew who bears a strong resemblance to Sister Blatt in Excellent Women. These and many more incidental characters come under Barbara Pym`s microscope. Phillip Larkin sums up what An Unsuitable Attachment means to Pym`s legion of admirers in his fascinating introduction, saying, `It is richly redolent of her unique talent...her followers will need no further recommendation. `</p></p><p>ALSO AVAILABLE: <br><b><i>Crampton Hodnet</i></b>, <br><b><i>A Few Green Leaves</i></b>, <br><b><i>Jane and Prudence</i></b>, <br><b><i>Some Tame Gazelle</i></b>, <br><b><i>The Sweet Dove Died</i></b>When the Times Literary Supplement asked critics to name the most underrated authors of the past 75 years, only one was mentioned twice: Barbara Pym.

Ministry leaders are eager to mentor others, but find themselves unable to personally meet the needs of the many women wanting to be discipled. The Women of Destiny Bible can help both groups. By combining the collective wisdom of the world's most respected Charismatic women leaders with the full NKJV text, this Bible allows women in leadership to communicate their experiences with God, their struggles and victories, their best advice to other women they look up to, women who are experts in their fields and uniquely qualified to help others "grow up" in God.</p></p><p>Scripture teaches that women should mentor, counsel, and be encouraged by other women. Editor Cindy Jacobs, president of a missionary organization called Generals of Intercession, has arranged the <i>Women of Destiny Bible</i> to do precisely that. With the help of over 100 female contributors such as Anna Hayford and Fuchsia Pickett, insight is shed upon countless readings of Scripture from a woman's perspective. From the warm welcome letter to the purple script throughout its pages, this decidedly feminine Bible is meant to draw women to a greater devotion to God. Mothers are mentored on how to discipline their children, single women receive biblical advice on finances and contentment, and all women are challenged to live with integrity. This mentoring unveils itself through "Women of Destiny Letters"--literal letters written by Christian women to inspire and convict the reader, through the compelling stories of "Heroines of the Faith" from Eve to Joan of Arc to Amy Carmichael, and through "Words of Wisdom" (short quotes) by famous and familiar Christian sojourners. This would be a wonderful gift or first-time Bible since it details how to use the Bible, how to know God, how to become a Christian, and how the gifts of the Holy Spirit manifest themselves. Despite its wonderful packaging, the Word of God promises to change your life. <i>--Jill Heatherly</i></p><h2>The Bible Exposition Commentary: Old Testament History (Old Testament Series)</h2><p>This book is the 5th volume in the compilation of the author's best-selling "Be" books on the Bible's books of history - from Joshua through Esther - in one convenient reference book.

Following a five decade career as a player and manager for baseball&#39;s most storied franchises, Durocher teamed up with veteran sportswriter Ed Linn to tell the story of his life in the game.

It was one of the boys&#x2019; birthday, but neither he nor the&nbsp;dozen resurfaced. Worried parents and rescuers flocked to the mouth of a cave that seemed to have swallowed the boys without a trace. Ranging in age from eleven to sixteen, the boys were all members of the Wild Boars soccer team. When water unexpectedly inundated the cave, blocking their escape, they retreated deeper inside, taking shelter in a side cavern. While the world feared them dead, the thirteen young souls survived by licking the condensation off the cave&#x2019;s walls, meditating, and huddling together for warmth.</p><p>In this thrilling account, ABC News Chief National Correspondent Matt Gutman recounts this amazing story in depth and from every angle, exploring their time in the cave, the failed plans and human mistakes that nearly doomed them, and the daring mission that ultimately saved them. Gutman introduces the elite team of volunteer divers who risked death to execute a plan so risky that its American planners admitted, &#x201c;for us, success would have meant getting just one boy out alive.&#x201d; He takes you inside the meetings where life and death decisions were grimly made and describes how these heroes pulled off an improbable rescue under immense pressure, with the boys&#x2019; desperate parents and the entire world watching. One of the largest rescues in history was in doubt until the very last moment. </p><p>Matt Gutman covered the story intensively, went deep inside the caves himself, and interviewed dozens of rescuers, experts and eye-witnessed around the world. The result is this pulse-pounding page-turner that vividly recreates this extraordinary event in all its intensity&#x2014;and documents the ingenuity and sacrifice it took to succeed. </p></p><p><p><strong>THE HARROWING BEHIND-THE-SCENES ACCOUNT OF THE BOYS, THE COACH, AND THE HEROES WHO SAVED THEM</strong></p><p>On June 23, 2018, twelve boys from a Thai youth soccer team and their twenty-four-year-old coach went missing in the Tham Luang cave in northern Thailand. Trapped inside the cave by monsoon rains, the teammates survived in darkness for ten days before being located by a pair of British cave divers who swam through a mile of narrow, flooded tunnels to find them. In the days that followed, millions of people around the world watched breathlessly as an elite group of international rescuers raced the clock and risked their own lives to ferry the soccer team to safety. </p><p>In <em>The Boys in the Cave</em>, ABC News Chief National Correspondent Matt Gutman reveals the hidden, behind-the-scenes drama of this remarkable rescue that united the world in hope. A veteran journalist who covered this story on the ground, Gutman offers a riveting account of the entire ordeal&#x2014;tracing the boys&#x2019; initial journey into the cave, the furious search and near drownings in the cave&#x2019;s tunnels, the tragic death of a Thai Navy SEAL, and finally the rescue that brought all the boys out safely. Through dozens of interviews, Gutman examines how a mission without precedent required the use of bold, untested methods; they were the only chance to save the boys&#x2019; lives. </p><p>From the British and Australian civilian rescue divers to the Thai Navy SEALs to a United States Air Force Special Tactics team, <em>The Boys in the Cave</em> reveals the full cast of unsung heroes who, working together in a once-in-a-lifetime display of international cooperation, converged on the cave in Thailand&#x2019;s &#x201c;Golden Triangle&#x201d; to pull off one of the most audacious rescues ever attempted. In addition, Gutman explores how the boys endured the cave for so long, relying on their wits and their unique bonds with each other and their coach to ensure their survival.</p><p>Including sixteen pages of photos documenting the cave and the efforts of the Thai and international experts on the ground, what emerges is an uplifting and untold story of teamwork, bravery, and hope that defies possibility, reminding us all of the power that exists when people from around the world join forces to solve the impossible.</p><p>Matt Gutman is the Chief National Correspondent for ABC News, and the host of the Saturday morning show <em>Sea Rescue.</em> A veteran journalist once held captive on the job, he has spent part of his career researching and reporting on human survival against impossible odds.

When it ends, Scott, now 18, is again waiting to cross the English Channel; he has been wounded in France and has been promoted to sergeant-not simply because he is a good soldier, but also because he has proven to be a "survivor," when so many others have been killed. Readers observe Scott lose both his belief that the Allied invasion will end the war quickly and his innocence-he has seen hundreds die, some by his own hand. While no more graphic than the subject demands, this brief novel presents an accurate depiction of the horror of battle. The narrative voice is engaging and believable, with only a few lapses that sound like explanations provided for today's readers. Scott emerges as a likable and realistic character, one who grows from youth to manhood in a matter of weeks. Young teens who appreciated Saving Private Ryan and The Thin Red Line ought to be moved and drawn to the Journal as well. A short epilogue gives thumbnail sketches of the major players' lives after wartime, and a photographic gallery helps set and expand the historical situation.<br><i>Coop Renner, Coldwell Elementary-Intermediate School, El Paso, TX </i><br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.Writing in May_ 1944, 17-year-old Collins has no inkling of the massive military offensive he is about to take part in. Myers captures nicely the shift from the fraternity and the boredom of life on the base to the terror and confusion of D-Day. The action and imagery are explicit but not exploitative as Collins survives the landing and pushes on through subsequent battles and skirmishes to secure the town of St. Lo, which is now little more than a pile of rubble topped by the ruins of Notre Dame. Myers' believable portrayal of Collins as a political naif may surprise readers who know far more about World War II than the soldier caught in its midst. The least successful elements here are the handful of letters to relatives and a girlfriend back home. They barely suggest a home life for Collins and don't reveal much of an inner life either. Though it doesn't dig beneath the surface of D-Day events, this My Name Is America series book is still an emotional read that should easily find an audience. <i>Randy Meyer</i></p><h2>Confronting Environmental Racism: Voices From the Grassroots</h2><p>The connection between racism and environmental quality is increasingly visible.

Once again, he has occasion to contact his former love, the adamantine Priscilla Halburton-Smyth, and her friend, Sarah Hudson, even helps Hamish hack into police records for his investigation. </p><p> Macbeth's efforts bustle charmingly along against the background of quirky Scots dialect and rustic pubs.

But behind the scenes in his New York studio is the freethinking Clara Driscoll, head of his women&#x2019;s division. Publicly unrecognized by Tiffany, Clara conceives of and designs nearly all of the iconic leaded-glass lamps for which he is long remembered.<br> <br>Clara struggles with her desire for artistic recognition and the seemingly insurmountable challenges that she faces as a professional woman, which ultimately force her to protest against the company she has worked so hard to cultivate. She also yearns for love and companionship, and is devoted in different ways to five men, including Tiffany, who enforces to a strict policy: he does not hire married women, and any who do marry while under his employ must resign immediately. Eventually, like many women, Clara must decide what makes her happiest&#x2014;the professional world of her hands or the personal world of her heart.</p><p><b>A Letter from Author Susan Vreeland</b> <br> <p></p> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <br><i>� Sam Ryu</i> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <b>Discovering Clara</b> <br> For a century, everyone assumed that the iconic Tiffany lamps were conceived and designed by that American master of stained glass, Louis Comfort Tiffany. Not so! It was a woman! Aha! <p></p> If it weren't for the Victorian zest for writing voluminous letters, Clara Driscoll would be only a footnote in the history of decorative arts. However, by an astonishing coincidence in 2005, three individuals unknown to each other--a distant relative of Clara, a Tiffany scholar, and an archivist at the Queens Historical Society--each aware of only one collection of Clara's letters, brought the correspondence to the attention of two art historians specializing in Tiffany, Martin Eidelberg and Nina Gray. <p></p> The result was electric. The two art historians contacted Margaret K. Hofer, Curator of Decorative Arts at the New York Historical Society which owns a huge collection of Tiffany lamps. Together they mounted an exhibition in 2007, <i>A New Light on Tiffany: Clara Driscoll and the Tiffany Girls</i>, in which Clara was hailed as "a gifted unsung artist" whose letters provided an eyewitness account of the workings of Tiffany Studios and revealed the vital role played by women. Their startling discovery rocked the art world. <p></p> While I was on tour in New York for my 2007 novel, <i>Luncheon of the Boating Party</i>, my agent and I went to the Metropolitan Museum of Art to see a lavish Tiffany exhibit recreating a portion of his fabled Long Island estate, Laurelton Hall. Instantly, I fell in love with Tiffany glass. By another coincidence, her husband spotted a review of the New York Historical Society exhibition, which we saw the next day. I was intrigued, but not convinced until I read the illuminating exhibition book as well as Clara's correspondence at the library of Kent State University, Ohio, and at the Queens Historical Society. <p></p> Poring over her letters, I discovered the wry, lively, sometimes rhapsodic voice of a freethinking woman who bicycled all around Manhattan and beyond, wore a riding skirt daringly shorter than street length, adored opera, followed the politics of the city even though she couldn't vote, and threw herself into the crush of Manhattan life--the Gilded Age uptown as well as the immigrant poverty of the Lower East Side. There before me in her own handwriting was an account of her making the first leaded-glass lampshade with mosaic base. I recognized her to be a dynamic yet tender leader who developed the Women's Department which created the nature-based lamps she designed. I rubbed my hands together in glee. <p></p> When I remembered that my mother, who lovingly called colors by their flower and fruit names, and who worked briefly as a lamp designer in Chicago in the 1930s, was required to resign from another position when she became engaged, just like the Tiffany Girls were required to do, I felt a personal connection to Clara. I sought out as many of her lamps as I could find, researched Tiffany and New York's cultural history in more than fifty books and articles, and then I eagerly settled down to write the story I felt was mine to tell. <p></p><b>Susan Vreeland</b> is the<i> New York Times</i> bestselling author of five books, including <i>Luncheon of the Boating Party, Life Studies, The Passion of Artemisia, The Forest Lover,</i> and<i> Girl in Hyacinth Blue.</i> She lives in San Diego.</p><h2>Field Guide to Medicinal Wild Plants</h2><p>First-ever revision of a classic guidebook.

The Taliban still controls Afghanistan, but Kabul is in ruins, Parvana's father has died, and her mother, sister and brother could be anywhere in the country. Parvana doesn't know where they are. She just knows she has to find them.<br> Parvana is twelve now, but she sets out alone, masquerading as a boy. Her journey becomes even more perilous when war breaks out, though she doesn't know why the bombs are falling. In her search for shelter and food as she makes her way across the desolate Afghan countryside, she meets other children who are strays from the war -- an infant boy in a bombed-out village; a nine-year-old girl who believes she has magical powers over landmines; and a boy with one leg who is so obnoxious that Parvana can hardly stand him. The children travel together because it is easier than being alone. And, as they forge their own family in the war zone that Afghanistan has become, their resilience, imagination and luck help them to survive.<br><br></p><p><b>Deborah Ellis</b> is the author of over&nbsp;18 books, many of them bestsellers worldwide. She lives in Simcoe, Ontario.Grade 7-10-This sequel to The Breadwinner (Groundwood, 2001) easily stands alone. After her father's death, 13-year-old Parvana, disguised as a boy, wanders alone through war-torn Afghanistan looking for her mother and siblings who had disappeared in the tumult of the Taliban takeover of Mazar-e-Sharif. Early in her journey, Parvana comes across a baby, the only survivor in a bombed village. She takes him along, as both a burden and comforting company. Taking shelter in a small cave, she discovers an angry one-legged boy who is starved for both food and human companionship. Imagining treasure in their cave, they dig, only to find a cache of bullets-a scene that epitomizes what childhood has become for these young people. The three continue Parvana's search, stopping for a time in an apparent safe haven on the edge of a minefield where an eight-year-old lives with a near-comatose grandmother. When their refuge is destroyed, the four children join a long line of refugees, arriving finally at a camp. A bittersweet ending offers some hope for Parvana and her family, but readers are left with a horrifyingly realistic picture of the effect of war on children. While the reading is not difficult, the grim content cries out for discussion.

Her marriage to James Lacey was a disaster from the beginning, and in the end, he left her-not for another woman, but for God. After having been miraculously cured of a brain tumor, James has decided to join a monastery in France. Agatha can usually depend on her old friend, Sir Charles Fraith, to be there when times are tough, but even Charles has abandoned her, dashing off to Paris to marry a young French tart. </p><p>Miserable and alone, Agatha hops on a plane and heads for a remote island in the South Pacific. To Agatha's surprise, she makes friends with her fellow travelers easily, and keeps herself out of mischief, despite the odd feeling she gets from one particularly attractive honeymooning couple. But when she later finds that the pretty bride has drowned under suspicious circumstances, Agatha wishes she had found a way to intervene. </p><p>Returning home to the Cotswolds, Agatha is grimly determined to move on with her life and to forget about James and Charles. They have, after all, forgotten about her. And what better way than to throw herself into another murder investigation?

Building and running a dictatorship, with life and death power over hundreds of millions, made Stalin into the uncanny figure he became. Stephen Kotkin&#x2019;s <i>Stalin: Waiting for Hitler, 1929&#x2013;1941</i> is the story of how a political system forged an unparalleled personality and <i>vice versa</i>.<br> &nbsp;<br> The wholesale collectivization of some 120 million peasants necessitated levels of coercion that were extreme even for Russia, and the resulting mass starvation elicited criticism inside the party even from those Communists committed to the eradication of capitalism. But Stalin did not flinch. By 1934, when the Soviet Union had stabilized and socialism had been implanted in the countryside, praise for his stunning anti-capitalist success came from all quarters. Stalin, however, never forgave and never forgot, with shocking consequences as he strove to consolidate the state with a brand new elite of young strivers like himself. Stalin&#x2019;s obsessions drove him to execute nearly a million people, including the military leadership, diplomatic and intelligence officials, and innumerable leading lights in culture.<br> &nbsp;<br> While Stalin revived a great power, building a formidable industrialized military, the Soviet Union was effectively alone and surrounded by perceived enemies. The quest for security would bring Soviet Communism to a shocking and improbable pact with Nazi Germany. But that bargain would not unfold as envisioned. The lives of Stalin and Hitler, and the fates of their respective dictatorships, drew ever closer to collision, as the world hung in the balance.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Stalin: Waiting for Hitler, 1929&#x2013;1941</i> is a history of the world during the build-up to its most fateful hour, from the vantage point of Stalin&#x2019;s seat of power. It is a landmark achievement in the annals of historical scholarship, and in the art of biography.</p><p><b>Stephen Kotkin</b> is the John P.

This is the most famous and at the same time the most unknown person in the world.</p><p>Henri Barbusse, <i>Stalin</i> (1935)</p><p>RUSSIA&#x2019;S DOUBLE-HEADED EAGLE NESTED across a greater expanse than that of any other state, before or since. The realm came to encompass not just the palaces of St. Petersburg and the golden domes of Moscow, but Polish and Yiddish-speaking Wilno and Warsaw, the German-founded Baltic ports of Riga and Reval, the Persian and Turkic-language oases of Bukhara and Samarkand (site of Tamerlane&#x2019;s tomb), and the Ainu people of Sakhalin Island near the Pacific Ocean. &#x201c;Russia&#x201d; encompassed the cataracts and Cossack settlements of wildly fertile Ukraine and the swamps and trappers of Siberia. It acquired borders on the Arctic and Danube, the Mongolian plateau, and Germany. The Caucasus barrier, too, was breached and folded in, bringing Russia onto the Black and Caspian seas, and giving it borders with Iran and the Ottoman empire. Imperial Russia came to resemble a religious kaleidoscope with a plenitude of Orthodox churches, mosques, synagogues, Old Believer prayer houses, Catholic cathedrals, Armenian Apostolic churches, Buddhist temples, and shaman totems. The empire&#x2019;s vast territory served as a merchant&#x2019;s paradise, epitomized by the slave markets on the steppes and, later, the crossroad fairs in the Volga valley. Whereas the Ottoman empire stretched over parts of three continents (Europe, Asia, and Africa), some observers in the early twentieth century imagined that the two-continent Russian imperium was neither Europe nor Asia but a third entity unto itself: Eurasia. Be that as it may, what the Venetian ambassador to the Sublime Porte (Agosto Nani) had once said of the Ottoman realm&#x2014;&#x201c;more a world than a state&#x201d;&#x2014;applied no less to Russia. Upon that world, Stalin&#x2019;s rule would visit immense upheaval, hope, and grief.</p><p>Stalin&#x2019;s origins, in the Caucasus market and artisan town of Gori, were exceedingly modest&#x2014;his father was a cobbler, his mother, a washerwoman and seamstress&#x2014;but in 1894 he entered an Eastern Orthodox theological seminary in Tiflis, the grandest city of the Caucasus, where he studied to become a priest. If in that same year a subject of the Russian empire had fallen asleep and awoken thirty years later, he or she would have been confronted by multiple shocks. By 1924 something called a telephone enabled near instantaneous communication over vast distances. Vehicles moved without horses. Humans flew in the sky. X-rays could see inside people. A new physics had dreamed up invisible electrons inside atoms, as well as the atom&#x2019;s disintegration in radioactivity, and one theory stipulated that space and time were interrelated and curved. Women, some of whom were scientists, flaunted newfangled haircuts and clothes, called fashions. Novels read like streams of dreamlike consciousness, and many celebrated paintings depicted only shapes and colors.1 As a result of what was called the Great War (1914&#x2013;18), the almighty German kaiser had been deposed and Russia&#x2019;s two big neighboring nemeses, the Ottoman and Austro-Hungarian empires, had disappeared. Russia itself was mostly intact, but it was ruled by a person of notably humble origins who also hailed from the imperial borderlands.2 To our imaginary thirty-year Rip Van Winkle in 1924, this circumstance&#x2014;a plebeian and a Georgian having assumed the mantle of the tsars&#x2014;could well have been the greatest shock of all.</p><p>Stalin&#x2019;s ascension to the top from an imperial periphery was uncommon but not unique. Napoleone di Buonaparte had been born the second of eight children in 1769 on Corsica, a Mediterranean island annexed only the year before by France; that annexation (from the Republic of Genoa) allowed this young man of modest privilege to attend French military schools. Napoleon (in the French spelling) never lost his Corsican accent, yet he rose to become not only a French general but, by age thirty-five, hereditary emperor of France. The plebeian Adolf Hitler was born entirely outside the country he would dominate: he hailed from the Habsburg borderlands, which had been left out of the 1871 German unification. In 1913, at age twenty-four, he relocated from Austria-Hungary to Munich, just in time, it turned out, to enlist in the imperial German army for the Great War. In 1923, Hitler was convicted of high treason for what came to be known as the Munich Beer Hall Putsch, but a German nationalist judge, ignoring the applicable law, refrained from deporting the non-German citizen. Two years later, Hitler surrendered his Austrian citizenship and became stateless. Only in 1932 did he acquire German citizenship, when he was naturalized on a pretext (nominally, appointed as a &#x201c;land surveyor&#x201d; in Braunschweig, a Nazi party electoral stronghold). The next year Hitler was named chancellor of Germany, on his way to becoming dictator. By the standards of a Hitler or a Napoleon, Stalin grew up as an unambiguous subject of his empire, Russia, which had annexed most of Georgia fully seventy-seven years before his birth. Still, his leap from the lowly periphery was improbable.</p><p>Stalin&#x2019;s dictatorial regime presents daunting challenges of explanation. His power of life and death over every single person across eleven time zones&#x2014;more than 200 million people at prewar peak&#x2014;far exceeded anything wielded by tsarist Russia&#x2019;s greatest autocrats. Such power cannot be discovered in the biography of the young Soso Jughashvili. Stalin&#x2019;s dictatorship, as we shall see, was a product of immense structural forces: the evolution of Russia&#x2019;s autocratic political system; the Russian empire&#x2019;s conquest of the Caucasus; the tsarist regime&#x2019;s recourse to a secret police and entanglement in terrorism; the European castle-in-the-air project of socialism; the underground conspiratorial nature of Bolshevism (a mirror image of repressive tsarism); the failure of the Russian extreme right to coalesce into a fascism despite all the ingredients; global great-power rivalries, and a shattering world war. Without all of this, Stalin could never have gotten anywhere near power. Added to these large-scale structural factors were contingencies such as the abdication of Tsar Nicholas II during wartime, the conniving miscalculations of Alexander Kerensky (the last head of the Provisional Government that replaced the tsar in 1917), the actions and especially inactions of Bolshevism&#x2019;s many competitors on the left, Lenin&#x2019;s many strokes and his early death in January 1924, and the vanity and ineptitude of Stalin&#x2019;s Bolshevik rivals.</p><p>Consider further that the young Jughashvili could have died from smallpox, as did so many of his neighbors, or been carried off by the other fatal diseases that were endemic in the slums of Batum and Baku, where he agitated for socialist revolution. Competent police work could have had him sentenced to forced labor (<i>katorga</i>) in a silver mine, where many a revolutionary met an early death. Jughashvili could have been hanged by the authorities in 1906&#x2013;7 as part of the extrajudicial executions in the crackdown following the 1905 revolution (more than 1,100 were hanged in 1905&#x2013;6).3 Alternatively, Jughashvili could have been murdered by the innumerable comrades he cuckolded. If Stalin had died in childhood or youth, that would not have stopped a world war, revolution, chaos, and likely some form of authoritarianism redux in post-Romanov Russia. And yet the determination of this young man of humble origins to make something of himself, his cunning, his honing of organizational talents would help transform the entire structural landscape of the early Bolshevik revolution from 1917. Stalin brutally, artfully, indefatigably built a personal dictatorship within the Bolshevik dictatorship. Then he launched and saw through a bloody socialist remaking of the entire former empire, presided over a victory in the greatest war in human history, and took the Soviet Union to the epicenter of global affairs. More than for any other historical figure, even Gandhi or Churchill, a biography of Stalin, as we shall see, eventually comes to approximate a history of the world.</p><p>&nbsp;�&nbsp;�&nbsp;�&nbsp;</p><p>WORLD HISTORY IS DRIVEN BY GEOPOLITICS. Among the great powers, the British empire, more than any other state, shaped the world in modern times. Between 1688 and 1815, the French fought the British for global supremacy. Despite France&#x2019;s greater land mass and population, Britain emerged the winner, mostly thanks to a superior, lean, fiscal-military state.4 By the final defeat of Napoleon, which was achieved in a coalition, the British were the world&#x2019;s dominant power. Their ascendancy, moreover, coincided with China&#x2019;s decline under the Qing dynasty, rendering British power&#x2014;political, military, industrial, cultural, and fiscal&#x2014;genuinely global. The felicitous phrase &#x201c;the sun never sets&#x201d; that was used to describe the extent of the empire&#x2019;s holdings originated in connection with the earlier empire of Spain, but the saying was applied, and stuck, to the British. In the 1870s, however, two ruptures occurred in the British-dominated world: Prince Otto von Bismarck&#x2019;s unification of Germany, realized on the battlefield by Helmuth von Moltke the Elder, which, in lightning fashion, led to the appearance of a surpassing new power on the European continent; and the Meiji restoration in Japan, which imparted tremendous drive to a new power in East Asia. All of a sudden, imperial Russia faced the world&#x2019;s most dynamic new power on its restive western border, and Asia&#x2019;s most dynamic on its underpopulated eastern border. Russia had entered a new world. This was the world into which Stalin was born.</p><p>Even the package of attributes that we call modernity was a result not of some inherent sociological process, a move out of tradition, but of a vicious geopolitical competition in which a state had to match the other great powers in modern steel production, modern militaries, and a modern, mass-based political system, or be crushed and potentially colonized.5 These were challenges that confronted conservative establishments especially. Everyone knows that Karl Marx, the radical German journalist and philosopher, loomed over imperial Russia like over no other place. But for most of Stalin&#x2019;s lifetime, it was another German&#x2014;and a conservative&#x2014;who loomed over the Russian empire: Otto von Bismarck. A country squire from a Protestant Junker family in eastern Brandenburg who had attended the University of Gottingen, joined a <i>Burschenschaften</i> (fraternity), and was known as a solid drinker and devotee of the female of the species, Bismarck had held no administrative posts as late as 1862, although he had been ambassador to Russia and to France. But in fewer than ten years, he had risen to become the Iron Chancellor and, using Prussia as his base, forged a mighty new country. Prussia, the proverbial &#x201c;army in search of a nation,&#x201d; had found one. At the same time, the rightist German chancellor showed rulers everywhere how to uphold modern state power by cultivating a broader political base, developing heavy industry, introducing social welfare, and juggling alliances with and against an array of other ambitious great powers.</p><p>Bismarck the statesman was one for the ages. He craftily upended his legions of opponents, both outside and inside the German principalities, and instigated three swift, decisive, yet limited wars to crush Denmark, then Austria, then France, but he kept the state of Austria-Hungary on the Danube for the sake of the balance of power. He created pretexts to attack when in a commanding position or baited the other countries into launching the wars after he had isolated them diplomatically. He made sure to have alternatives, and played these alternatives off against each other. That said, Bismarck had had no master plan for German unity&#x2014;his enterprise was an improvisation, driven partly by domestic political considerations (to tame the liberals in Prussia&#x2019;s parliament). But he had constantly worked circumstances and luck to supreme advantage, breaking through structural limitations, creating new realities on the ground. &#x201c;Politics is less a science than an art,&#x201d; Bismarck would say. &#x201c;It is not a subject that can be taught. One must have the talent for it. Even the best advice is of no avail if improperly carried out.&#x201d;6 He further spoke of politics in terms of cards, dice, and other games of chance. &#x201c;One can be as shrewd as the shrewdest in this world and still at any moment go like a child into the dark,&#x201d; Bismarck had remarked on the victory in the war he instigated in 1864 against Denmark.7 This he complained was &#x201c;a thankless job.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. One has to reckon with a series of probabilities and improbabilities and base one&#x2019;s plans upon this reckoning.&#x201d; Bismarck did not invoke virtue, but only power and interests. Later this style of rule would become known as realpolitik, a term coined by August von Rochau (1810-73), a German National Liberal disappointed in the failure to break through to a constitution in 1848. In its origins, realpolitik signified effective practical politics to realize idealistic aims. Bismarck&#x2019;s style was more akin to the term raison d&#x2019;etat: calculating, amoral reason of state. Instead of principles, there were objectives; instead of morality, means.8 Bismarck was widely hated until he proved brilliantly successful, then lionized beyond reason for having smashed France, made a vassal out of Austria, and united Germany.</p><p>Bismarck went on to form the Triple Alliance with Austria-Hungary and Italy (1882) and sign a secret &#x201c;reinsurance treaty&#x201d; with Russia (1888), extracting neutrality in the event of a conflict, thereby obviating a possible two-front war against France and Russia and accentuating the new Germany&#x2019;s mastery of the continent. His gifts were those of the inner sanctum. He did not possess a strong voice or self-confidence in speaking, and did not spend much time amid the public. Moreover, he was not the ruler: he served at the pleasure of the king (and then kaiser), Wilhelm I. In that all-important relationship, Bismarck showed psychological skill and tenacity, ceaselessly, efficaciously manipulating Wilhelm I, threatening his resignation, pulling all manner of histrionics. Wilhelm I, for his part, proved to be a diligent, considerate, and intelligent monarch, with the smarts to defer to Bismarck on policy and to attend to the myriad feathers his Iron Chancellor ruffled.9 Bismarck strategized to make himself indispensable partly by making everything as complex as possible, so that he alone knew how things worked (this became known as his combinations). He had so many balls up in the air at all times that he could never stop scrambling to prevent any from dropping, even as he was tossing up still more. It must also be kept in mind that Bismarck enjoyed the benefit of the world&#x2019;s then-best land army (and perhaps second-best navy).</p><p>Other would-be statesmen across Europe went to school with Bismarck&#x2019;s example of &#x201c;politics as art.&#x201d;10 To be sure, from the perspective of London, which had well-established rule of law, Bismarck appeared as a menace. But from the perspective of St. Petersburg, where the challenges were finding a bulwark against leftist extremism, he looked like salvation.

But beneath this man or myth, or some combination of the two, is another Hemingway, one we&#x2019;ve never seen before. Hadley Richardson, Hemingway&#x2019;s first wife, is the perfect person to reveal him to us -- and also to immerse us in the incredibly exciting and volatile world of Jazz-age Paris. <p>The idea to write in Hadley&#x2019;s voice came to me as I was reading Hemingway&#x2019;s memoir, <em>A Moveable Feast</em>, about his early years in Paris. In the final pages, he writes of Hadley, &#x201c;I wished I had died before I ever loved anyone but her.&#x201d; That line, and his portrayal of their marriage -- so tender and poignant and steeped in regret -- inspired me to search out biographies of Hadley, and then to research their brief and intense courtship and letters -- they wrote hundreds and hundreds of pages of delicious pages to another!</p> <p>I couldn&#x2019;t help but fall in love with Hadley, and through her eyes, with the young Ernest Hemingway. He was just twenty when they met, handsome and magnetic, passionate and sensitive and full of dreams. I was surprised at how much I liked and admired him -- and before I knew it, I was entirely swept away by their gripping love story.</p> <p>I hope you will be as captivated by this remarkable couple as I am -- and by the fascinating world of Paris in the 20&#x2019;s, the fast-living, ardent and tremendously driven Lost Generation.</p> <p><strong>A Look Inside <em>The Paris Wife</em></strong> <br> </p><table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <br> Ernest and Hadley Hemingway, Chamby, Switzerland, winter 1922</td> <td> <br> Ernest and Hadley Hemingway on their wedding day, 1921</td> <td> <br> Ernest, Hadley, and Bumby, Schruns, Austria, 1925 <br></td> <td> <br> The Hemingways and friends at a cafe in Pamplona, Spain <br></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <strong>Guest Reviewer: Helen Simonson on <em>The Paris Wife</em></strong> <br><p></p> <p> </p><table> <tbody> <tr> <td></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <em><strong>Helen Simonson</strong> is the </em>New York Times<em> bestselling author of </em>Major Pettigrew&#x2019;s Last Stand<em>.

To make life more difficult, McLain proposes to tell us about Ernest Hemingway&#x2019;s first wife, Hadley Richardson, who is a twenty-eight-year-old Midwestern spinster when she marries the twenty-one-year-old unpublished, (but already cocksure) writer and runs off to Paris with him. The talent and joy of this novel is that McLain does a startling job of making us understand this as a great love story and seducing us into caring deeply, about both Ernest and Hadley, as their marriage eventually comes apart.</p> <p>This novel moves beyond the dry bones of biography or skewed personal vision of memoir, and takes a leap into the emotional lives of these characters. It is a leap of faith for those readers who think they know Hemingway, but McLain&#x2019;s voice sticks close enough to historical material, and to the words and tone of Hemingway&#x2019;s own writing, to be convincing. She had me at the description of young Hadley&#x2019;s father committing suicide.</p> <p>&#x201c;The carpets had been cleaned but not changed out for new, the revolver had been emptied and polished and placed back in his desk.&#x201d;</p> <p>Hadley is also crippled by a childhood fall and trapped into spinsterhood by her mother&#x2019;s declining health and eventual death. By the time she meets Hemingway, we are rooting for her to make a break for foreign shores--even as we understand the danger of marrying a tempestuous man. Hemingway is all nervous purpose, ambition and charisma as he meets Hadley and is drawn to her quiet strength and ordinary American sweetness. In his youth and uncertainty, she is his rock and yet we already suspect that as he grows in artistic power, she will become an unwanted anchor. Through Hadley&#x2019;s eyes and plain-speaking voice, we see all of twenties Paris and the larger-than-life artists who gather in the cafes. We drink tea with Gertrude Stein and champagne with Fitzgerald and Zelda. We run with the bulls in Pamplona and spend winters in alpine chalets. And we see, through her love for him, the young writer becoming the Hemingway of legend. Perhaps it is the nature of all great artists to be completely selfish and obnoxious, but Hadley&#x2019;s voice is always one of compassion. Even as Hemingway leaves her completely out of <em>The Sun also Rises</em>, even as Hemingway publicly flirts with other women, she continues to explain and defend him. It is a testament to Paula McLain that the reader is slow to dislike Hemingway, even as he slowly and inexorably betrays Hadley&#x2019;s trust.</p> <p>I loved this novel for its depiction of two passionate, yet humanly-flawed people struggling against impossible odds--poverty, artistic fervor, destructive friendships--to cling on to each other.

Is the human body designed to eat plant foods, animal foods, or both? Respectively, are we herbivores, carnivores, or omnivores? </p><p> While the human gastrointestinal tract is capable of digesting both plant and animal foods, there are indications that we evolved to digest primarily plant foods. Specifically, our teeth are composed of twenty molars, which are perfect for crushing and grinding plant foods, along with eight front incisors, which are well suited for biting into fruits and vegetables. Only our front four canine teeth are designed for meat eating, and our jaws swing both vertically to tear and laterally to crush, while carnivores' jaws swing only vertically. Additional evidence that supports the human body's preference for plant foods is the long length of the human intestinal tract. Carnivores typically have a short bowel, while herbivores have a bowel length proportionally comparable to humans'. </p><p> To answer the question of what humans should eat, many researchers look to other primates, such as chimpanzees, monkeys, and gorillas. These nonhuman wild primates are omnivores. They are also often described as herbivores and opportunistic carnivores in that although they eat mainly fruits and vegetables, they may also eat small animals, lizards, and eggs if given the opportunity. For example, the gorilla and the orangutan eat only 1 percent and 2 percent of animal foods as a percentage of total calories, respectively. The remainder of their diet is derived from plant foods. Since humans are between the weight of the gorilla and orangutan, it has been suggested that humans are designed to eat around 1.5 percent of their diet in the form of animal foods. However, most Americans derive well over 50 percent of their calories from animal foods. </p><p> Since wild primates fill up on wild fruit and other highly nutritious plant foods, those weighing one tenth the amount of a typical human ingest nearly ten times the level of vitamin C and much higher amounts of many other vitamins and minerals (see Table 1.1). How is this possible? One reason is that the cultivated fruit in an American supermarket is far different from the wild fruit of the primate's diet, having a slightly higher protein content and a higher content of certain essential vitamins and minerals. Cultivated fruit tends to be higher in sugars and, while very tasty to humans, it is not nearly as nutritious. In fact, it raises blood sugar levels much more quickly than its wild counterparts do. </p><p> There are other differences in the wild primate diet that are also important to highlight, such as a higher ratio of alpha-linolenic acid -- the essential omega-3 fatty acid -- to linoleic acid -- the essential omega-6 fatty acid. A higher ratio of omega-3 fatty acid decreases the likelihood of the development of inflammatory and chronic diseases as well as their severity. Finally, the wild primate diet is very high in fiber, while the average American diet is not. A high-fiber diet protects against heart disease and many types of cancer. </p><p> Determining what diet humans are best suited for may not be as simple as looking at the diet of wild primates. Humans have some significant structural and physiological differences compared to apes. The key difference may be our larger, more metabolically active brains. In fact, it has been theorized that a shift in dietary intake to more animal foods may have produced the stimulus for human brain growth. The shift itself was probably the result of limited food availability, which forced early humans to hunt grazing mammals such as antelope and gazelle. Archaeological data support this association -- humans' brains started to grow and become more developed at about the same time evidence shows an increase of animal bones being butchered with stone tools at early villages. </p><p> While improved dietary quality alone cannot fully explain why human brains grew, it definitely appears to have played a critical role. With their bigger brains, early humans were able to engage in more complex social behavior, which led to improved foraging and hunting tactics, which, in turn, led to even higher quality food intake that fostered additional brain evolution. </p><p> Data from anthropologists looking at evidence from hunter-gatherer cultures is providing much insight as to what humans are designed to eat. However, it is important to point out that these cultures were not entirely free to determine their diets. Instead, their diets were molded as a result of what was available to them. For example, the diet of the Inuit Eskimos is far different from that of the Australian Aborigines. Therefore, it may not be appropriate to answer the question "What should humans eat?" simply by looking at these studies alone. </p><p> Nonetheless, regardless of whether a hunter-gatherer community relied on animal or plant foods, the rate of diseases of civilization such as heart disease and cancers was extremely low. </p><p> How is this possible? One reason is that the meat our ancestors consumed was much different from the meat we find in the supermarket today. Domesticated animals have always had higher fat levels than their wild counterparts, but the desire for tender meat has driven the fat content of domesticated animals to 25 to 30 percent or higher compared to a fat content of less than 4 percent for free-living animals or wild game. In addition, the type of fat is considerably different. Domestic beef contains primarily saturated fats and virtually undetectable amounts of omega-3 fatty acids. In contrast, the fat of wild animals contains over five times more polyunsaturated fat per gram and has desirable amounts of beneficial omega-3 fatty acids (approximately 4 percent). </p><p> What conclusions can we draw from the evidence of the wild primate and hunter-gatherer diets about how we should eat today? Overwhelmingly, it appears that humans are better suited to a diet composed primarily of plant foods. This position is supported also by a tremendous amount of evidence showing that deviating from a predominantly plant-based diet is a major factor in the development of heart disease, cancer, strokes, arthritis, and many other chronic degenerative diseases. It is now the recommendation of many health and medical organizations that the human diet should focus primarily on plant-based foods, comprising vegetables, fruits, grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds. </p><p> The evidence supporting diet's role in chronic degenerative diseases is substantial. There are two basic facts linking the diet-disease connection: </p><p> 1. A diet rich in plant foods is protective against many diseases that are extremely common in Western society. </p><p> 2. A diet providing a low intake of plant foods is a causative factor in the development of these diseases and provides conditions under which other causative factors became more active. </p><p> <b>The Pioneering Work of Denis Burkitt and Hugh Trowell</b> </p><p> Much of the link between diet and chronic disease originated from the work of two medical pioneers: Denis Burkitt, M.D., and Hugh Trowell, M.D., editors of Western Diseases: Their Emergence and Prevention, first published in 1981. Although now extremely well recognized, the work of Burkitt and Trowell is actually a continuation of the landmark work of Weston A. Price, a dentist and author of Nutrition and Physical Degeneration. In the early 1900s, Dr. Price traveled the world observing changes in teeth and palate (orthodontic) structure as various cultures discarded traditional dietary practices in favor of a more "civilized" diet. Price was able to follow individuals as well as cultures over periods of twenty to forty years, and he carefully documented the onset of degenerative diseases as their diets changed. </p><p> Based on the extensive studies examining the rate of diseases in various populations (epidemiological data), including the groundbreaking work of Dr. Price and their own observations of primitive cultures, Burkitt and Trowell formulated the following sequence of events: </p><p> <b>First stage:</b> In cultures consuming a traditional diet consisting of whole, unprocessed foods, the rate of chronic diseases, such as heart disease, diabetes, and cancer is quite low. </p><p> <b>Second stage:</b> Commencing with eating a more "Western" diet, there is a sharp rise in the number of individuals with obesity and diabetes. </p><p> <b>Third stage:</b> As more and more people abandon their traditional diet, conditions that were once quite rare become extremely common. </p><p> Examples of these conditions include constipation, hemorrhoids, varicose veins, and appendicitis. </p><p> <b>Fourth stage:</b> Finally, with full Westernization of the diet, other chronic degenerative or potentially lethal diseases, including heart disease, cancer, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and gout, become extremely common. </p><p> Since the publication in Western Diseases of Burkitt and Trowell's pioneering research, a virtual landslide of data has continually verified the role of the Western diet as the key factor in virtually every chronic disease, but especially in obesity and diabetes. In 1984, the Food and Nutrition Board of the National Research Council established the Committee on Diet and Health to undertake a comprehensive analysis on diet and major chronic diseases. Their findings, as well as those of the U.S. surgeon general, the National Cancer Institute, and other highly respected medical groups brought to the forefront the need for Americans to change their eating habits to reduce their risk for chronic disease. Table 1.2 lists diseases with convincing links to a diet low in plant foods. Many of these now-common diseases were extremely rare before the twentieth century. </p><p> <b>Trends in U.S. Food Consumption</b> </p><p> During the twentieth century, food consumption patterns changed dramatically. Total dietary fat intake increased from 32 percent of calories in 1909 to 43 percent by the end of the century; carbohydrate intake dropped from 57 ...</p></p><h2>Acts for Everyone, Part Two (The New Testament for Everyone)</h2><p><p>Writing in an accessable and anecdotal style, Tom Wright helps us to approach the rich and many-sided story of the book of Acts.

The same twenty-year avoidable disparity exists in the Calton and Lenzie neighborhoods of Glasgow, and in other cities around the world.</p><p>In Sierra Leone, one in 21 fifteen-year-old women will die in her fertile years of a maternal-related cause; in Italy, the figure is one in 17,100; but in the United States, which spends more on healthcare than any other country in the world, it is one in 1,800 (and now, with the new administration chipping away at Obamacare, the statistics stand to grow even more devastating). Why?</p><p>Dramatic differences in health are not a simple matter of rich and poor; poverty alone doesn't drive ill health, but inequality does. Indeed, suicide, heart disease, lung disease, obesity, and diabetes, for example, are all linked to social disadvantage. In every country, people at relative social disadvantage suffer health disadvantage and shorter lives. Within countries, the higher the social status of individuals, the better their health. These health inequalities defy the usual explanations. Conventional approaches to improving health have emphasized access to technical solutions and changes in the behavior of individuals, but these methods only go so far. What really makes a difference is creating the conditions for people to have control over their lives, to have the power to live as they want. Empowerment is the key to reducing health inequality and thereby improving the health of everyone. Marmot emphasizes that the rate of illness of a society as a whole determines how well it functions; the greater the health inequity, the greater the dysfunction.</p><p>Marmot underscores that we have the tools and resources materially to improve levels of health for individuals and societies around the world, and that to not do so would be a form of injustice. Citing powerful examples and startling statistics (&#x201c;young men in the U.S. have less chance of surviving to sixty than young men in forty-nine other countries&#x201d;), <i>The Health Gap</i> presents compelling evidence for a radical change in the way we think about health and indeed society, and inspires us to address the societal imbalances in power, money, and resources that work against health equity.</p></p><p>Sir <b>Michael Marmot</b> was knighted by Her Majesty The Queen for services to Epidemiology and understanding health inequalities. He is a Professor of Epidemiology and Public Health at University College London. He chaired the World Health Organization's Commission on Social Determinants of Health, and the European Review of Social Determinants and the Health Divide, and chaired a review of health inequalities across the Americas for the WHO's Pan-American Health Organization (PAHQ). His recommendations have been adopted by the World Health Assembly and by many countries. The British Government appointed him to conduct a review of social determinants and health inequalities; the Marmot Review and its recommendations are now being implemented in three-quarters of local authorities in England. He is the author of <i>The</i> <i>Status Syndrome</i>, and lives in North London.<p>&#x201c;Michael Marmot&#x2019;s path-breaking work on the social determinants of health has made all of us rethink healthcare and social medicine. This is a lesson of tremendous practical importance to the world.&#x201d; &#x2015;Amartya Sen</p><p>"Marmot convincingly details how socioeconomic inequities lead to health inequities . . . [He] passionately argues for people everywhere to promote a more 'just distribution of health' . . . Like a good courtroom attorney, Marmot builds a strong case and calls for action." &#x2015;<i>Booklist</i></p><p>"[T]he author creates a strong case for policy changes that address human needs for autonomy, empowerment, and freedom in order to improve the well-being of people globally who are living in vulnerable and disadvantaged circumstances." &#x2015;<i>Library Journal</i></p><p>"[Marmot's] research over the years has generated a catalogue of shocking headline findings, which are collected in this book to devastating effect. Page after page rams home the message that the poorer you are, the more likely you are to live a shorter, less healthy and in all likelihood less happy life . . . <i>The Health Gap </i>briskly and coherently explores why this might be the case . . . But Marmot is no doom-monger. Quite the opposite . . . this is a fundamentally optimistic book." &#x2015;<i>The Independent</i></p><p>"Dr. Marmot weaves a masterful treatise on world financial and trade policy, availability of education to all people, and the robustness of infrastructure to support health status . . . To learn more about creative initiatives throughout the world that are improving conditions for human beings, buy this book, a bargain at any price." &#x2015;<i>New York Journal of Books</i></p><p>"Now's the time to . . change the way we think about health. In his new book, UCL professor Michael Marmot reveals that the average person would have eight extra years of healthy life if they had the same opportunities as the richest in our society . . It's time to stop seeing health as a matter of lifestyle choice and start campaigning for justice--for all our sakes." &#x2015;<i>The Observer</i></p><p>&#x201c;Marmot's important study shows that--in every culture--our happiness and health are closely related to the place we occupy in the status hierarchy, and that that the key to status is our occupation.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>The Guardian on STATUS SYNDROME</i></p><p>&#x201c;Bubbling with findings, discreetly illuminated by the light of social justice, written considerately for ordinary readers . . .

Throughout his life, he wrote to his younger brother, Theo, about his colorful, dynamic paintings. This book pairs the artist's paintings with his own words. <p>Van Gogh's descriptions, arranged as a simple rhyme, introduce young readers to all the colors of the rainbowand beyond. The descriptive words combine with spectacular reproductions of many of the artist's most beloved and important works to create a perfect art book for young and old alike.</p></p><p>Vincent Van Gogh (1853-1890)*Starred Review* Gr. 1-3. This slim volume, produced by the Metropolitan Museum of Art, is an extraordinary accomplishment. Editor William Lach takes Van Gogh's own words from his letters to his brother, Theo, translated closely or freely from French or Dutch, to describe the colors of some of his most famous and beloved paintings. Lach has rhymed them gently: "Leaves of silver turning to green, / stars sparkling, greenish, yellow, white, / a big bunch of violet irises, / and in my head a starry night." There's a single line of text per spread, each opposite a full reproduction or a detail of the painting that corresponds to the line. The book begins with a very brief introduction and ends with a complete list of the paintings, including full descriptions and a citation for the correspondence from which each description comes. Children--and their adults--will marvel at the sunflowers that are "twelve flowers that are light on light" or "a lady's clothes in black, black, black."

Too many Christians do not understand the essential truths of the pro-life position, making it difficult for them to articulate a biblical worldview on issues like abortion, cloning, and embryo research.</p><p><em>The Case for Life</em> provides intellectual grounding for the pro-life convictions that most evangelicals hold. Author Scott Klusendorf first simplifies the debate: the sanctity of life is not a morally complex issue. It's not about choice, privacy, or scientific progress. To the contrary, the debate turns on one key question: What is the unborn? From there readers learn how to engage the great bio-tech debate of the twenty-first century, how to answer objections persuasively, and what the role of the pro-life pastor should be.</p></p><p><p><strong>Scott Klusendorf</strong> is the president of Life Training Institute, where he trains pro-life advocates to persuasively defend their views. A passionate and engaging platform speaker, Scott's pro-life presentations have been featured by Focus on the Family, Truths That Transform, and American Family Radio. Scott is a graduate of UCLA and the author of <em>Pro-Life 101</em>.</p><p>President, Life Training Institute; author, <em>The Case for Life: Equipping Christians to Engage the Culture</em></p><p>"Scott Klusendorf has produced a marvelous resource that will equip pro-lifers to communicate more creatively and effectively as they engage our culture. The Case for Life is well-researched, well-written, logical, and clear, containing many pithy and memorable statements. Those already pro-life will be equipped; those on the fence will likely be persuaded. Readers looking to speak up for those who cannot speak for themselves will find much here to say. I highly recommend this book."<br>&#x2015;<strong>Randy Alcorn,</strong> author, <em>Heaven</em>; <em>If God Is Good</em>; and <em>Hand in Hand</em></p><p>"Scott Klusendorf takes the insights and methods for defending the right to life he so effectively communicates in his teaching presentations into a book that provides a clear and cogent biblical rationale for the sanctity and dignity of life, born or unborn. This is a great tool for the layman who knows he or she is pro-life, but doesn't understand the presuppositions on which his or her beliefs are based or who doesn't feel equipped to defend or discuss the issue with others."<br>&#x2015;<strong>Charles Colson</strong>, Founder, Prison Fellowship and the Colson Center for Christian Worldview</p><p>"The Case for Life is a veritable feast of helpful information about pro-life issues, the finest resource about these matters I have seen.

Klusendorf not only equips the reader with incisive, insightful responses to pro-abortion arguments, he also presents a full defense of the biblical worldview." <br>&#x2015;<strong>Paul Copan, </strong>Pledger Family Chair of Philosophy and Ethics, Palm Beach Atlantic University</p><p>"This book will equip the reader to articulate both a philosophical case and a biblical case for life and to answer intelligently and persuasively the main objections to the pro-life position. It is easy to follow and hard to put down." <br>&#x2015;<strong>Patrick Lee</strong>, McAleer Professor of Bioethics, Director, Institute of Bioethics, Franciscan University of Steubenville</p><p>"The Case for Life: Equipping Christians to Engage Culture by Scott Klusendorf is prophetic and practical. It is prophetic in the sense that it makes a clear and undeniable argument based on truth about human value. It gives a biblically informed pro-life view. It is practical because it provides pro-life advocates a toolbox for offering understandable defenses for the unborn. It shows how to logically answer objections and move a debate to a dialogue. As a pastor, I was challenged, informed, and inspired to confidently and graciously make a difference in my generation for the cause of life."<br>&#x2015;<strong>Jimmy Dale Patterson,</strong> Senior Pastor, First Baptist Church, Newman, Georgia</p></p><h2>Catch Me (Detective D.

The fate of humanity is at stake here and you want me to rely on someone who&#x2019;s barely a teenager?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Desperate times call for desperate measures,&#x201d; Dante said.<br> <br>&#x201c;These measures aren&#x2019;t desperate. They&#x2019;re insane.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, maybe it&#x2019;s time we tried something crazy. The CIA has been using the same old techniques to find Pandora for almost seventy years, and they haven&#x2019;t gotten us anywhere. They certainly didn&#x2019;t work in Bern.&#x201d;<br> <br>Director Carter&#x2019;s gaze went cold, making Dante think that he&#x2019;d pushed things too far. But then Carter gave a slight nod, conceding that he was right, and sat back in her chair to think.<br> <br>Dante had seen the director lapse into deep thought before, though never when he was the only one in the room with her. The previous times, he had been a junior agent, relegated to the background, expected only to observe and keep his mouth shut. Carter&#x2019;s long pauses to think in meetings were legendary at the Agency. She had been known to not say anything for up to ten minutes, during which she expected complete silence. This could be awkward for the other agents in the room, but they all greatly respected Carter&#x2014;revered her even&#x2014;and so they dealt with it.<br> <br>Jamilla Carter was in her sixties, the rare CIA director who had risen to the job by being an exceptional agent rather than a political appointee. Her piercing brown eyes stood out against her dark skin. She had been an analyst, rather than a field operative, but then, most CIA employees were analysts, and Carter was one of the best.<br> <br>Carter was in analysis mode now. She picked up the file Dante had assembled on Charlie Thorne and leafed through it for what was probably the twentieth time that day.<br> <br>Dante grew uncomfortable watching her, so he let his gaze drift out the window. It was January and the sky was roofed with gray clouds. Squalls of snowflakes swirled outside the window. Even on a sunny day, the buildings of CIA headquarters were drab; today they looked ominous and foreboding.<br> <br>Carter&#x2019;s eyes shifted from the file to the photograph once again.<br> <br>Charlotte Thorne, aka Charlie, was a mix of many different races, although she didn&#x2019;t look like one more than any other. If Charlie had been ten years older, this would have been a huge asset. She could have passed for a very tan white person, a light-skinned black person, or Hispanic or Arab or Indian, or even partly Chinese. Looks like that would allow you to blend in anywhere on earth, to pass yourself off as almost any culture if you could speak the language.<br> <br>But Dante hadn&#x2019;t suggested Charlie because of her appearance. It was because of her intelligence. Her IQ was off the charts. Director Carter had dozens of certified geniuses under her at the CIA, and none of them had IQs as high as Charlie Thorne&#x2019;s. Carter wouldn&#x2019;t have believed anyone could score that high if Dante hadn&#x2019;t provided three separate reports from respected psychologists to confirm it.<br> <br>Carter flipped through the psych reports again. She had read them twice already. The second time, she had marked them with a red pen, circling words or phrases that were important to her, for reasons that were good or bad. Finally, she looked back at Dante.<br> <br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s brilliant,&#x201d; Carter said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll give you that.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s beyond brilliant,&#x201d; Dante corrected. &#x201c;She speaks at least twelve languages and can understand more. She&#x2019;s already been accepted to college, studying advanced math and theoretical physics. She has a photographic memory. . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s no such thing as a photographic memory.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, hers is as close as it gets. Her mind is wired differently than ours. She knows everything about everything. Science, history, art . . . you name it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Perhaps. But there are other characteristics of her personality that are more worrisome.&#x201d; Carter tapped some of the reports where she had made notes. &#x201c;Rebellious. Headstrong. Conceited. Disrespectful of authority.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Do you know who else was like that as a child?&#x201d; Dante asked. &#x201c;Albert Einstein. As well as Leonardo da Vinci, Isaac Newton, Charles Darwin, Benjamin Franklin, and every other groundbreaking genius you can name. Anyone that brilliant is going to chafe at authority. Because they&#x2019;re smarter than the authorities.&#x201d; Dante leaned across the conference table. &#x201c;The CIA has been searching for Pandora ever since Einstein died, and we&#x2019;ve gotten nowhere. So maybe we need someone as smart as Einstein to find it. And the closest person we have to Einstein right now is her.&#x201d; Dante thumped his finger on the photo of Charlie Thorne.<br> <br>Carter&#x2019;s eyes fell to the photo again, then returned to Dante. Agent Garcia was mentally gifted himself; that was why Director Carter was even sitting here with him, considering his radical suggestion, when she had a thousand other things to do. Like dealing with the fallout from Bern.<br> <br>Dante was only twenty-eight, but he had already proved himself in the field many times, rising rapidly through the ranks. Like Charlie Thorne, he was a blend of races, able to pass as almost any ethnicity he wanted, meaning he had served all over the world.<br> <br>&#x201c;Miss Thorne&#x2019;s disrespect for authority probably goes much farther than Einstein&#x2019;s ever did,&#x201d; Director Carter said. &#x201c;As far as we know, Einstein never broke the law, whereas Miss Thorne has. And in rather spectacular fashion.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s exactly why she&#x2019;ll work for us.&#x201d;<br> <br>Carter arched an eyebrow. &#x201c;You want to blackmail her into helping us? That&#x2019;s not exactly going to make her respectful of authority.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I can handle her.&#x201d;<br> <br>Carter leafed through the file on Charlie Thorne one last time, considering all the possible ramifications of bringing this girl aboard. The kid was a risky play, for sure. The chances were high that it wouldn&#x2019;t work. And yet, as Agent Garcia had said, these were desperate times. Carter&#x2019;s intelligence said the Furies were closing in on Pandora; meanwhile the CIA was no closer than it had been seven decades ago.<br> <br>&#x201c;This will have to be an unsanctioned mission,&#x201d; Carter said. &#x201c;Completely off the books. There can&#x2019;t be any record that the CIA is coercing twelve-year-olds to work for us.&#x201d;<br> <br>Dante smiled. &#x201c;Of course not.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That means a bare-bones operation as well. Only you and one other agent.&#x201d;<br> <br>Dante&#x2019;s smile faded. &#x201c;Only one other? That&#x2019;s crazy!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Weren&#x2019;t you just telling me it was time to try something crazy? If it helps, you can select whoever you want.&#x201d;<br> <br>Dante didn&#x2019;t hesitate for a second. &#x201c;Milana Moon.&#x201d;<br> <br>Director Carter nodded. Even though she had thousands of agents working under her, she knew exactly who Moon was. The fact that Dante had named her so quickly simply confirmed his intelligence to her. &#x201c;Fine. If she&#x2019;ll agree to it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I think I can convince her.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Then we&#x2019;re done here.&#x201d; Carter snapped to her feet and slid the file back across the conference table to Dante. &#x201c;Destroy that. And then go find Pandora.&#x201d;</p><h2>Road to Valor: A True Story of WWII Italy, the Nazis, and the Cyclist Who Inspired a Nation</h2><p><b>The inspiring, against-the-odds story of Gino Bartali, the cyclist who made the greatest<i> </i>comeback in Tour de France history and secretly aided the Italian resistance during World War II</b><br><br>Gino Bartali is best known as an Italian cycling legend who not only won the Tour de France twice but also holds the record for the longest time span between victories. In <i>Road to Valor, </i>Aili and Andres McConnon chronicle Bartali&#x2019;s journey, from an impoverished childhood in rural Tuscany&nbsp;to his first triumph at the 1938 Tour de France. As World War II ravaged Europe, Bartali undertook dangerous activities to help those being targeted in&nbsp;Italy, including sheltering a family of Jews and smuggling counterfeit identity documents in the frame of his bicycle. After the&nbsp;grueling&nbsp;wartime years, the chain-smoking, Chianti-loving, 34-year-old underdog came back to win the 1948 Tour de France, an exhilarating performance that helped unite his fractured homeland.<br><br>Based on nearly ten years of research, <i>Road to Valor </i>is<i> </i>the first book ever written about Bartali in English and the only book written in any language to explore the full scope of Bartali&#x2019;s wartime work.

This time you, and the next time me," Gino shouted ahead to his younger brother, Giulio, as they pedaled up the steep, sun-drenched hills surrounding Ponte a Ema. Their tires kicked up clouds of grit, and it was all Gino could do to avoid swallowing a mouthful. He rubbed a sweaty palm against his shorts, trying to brush off the stubborn rust flakes from his bike frame, and tucked his elbows in alongside his body, the way his idols did as they sprinted to victory, clutching their sleek curved handlebars. Gino leaned into the pedals and sped past Giulio. He turned and grinned at his younger brother as they started their descent toward home. They would race again tomorrow, and on that forgotten stretch of Tuscan road their tomorrows seemed endless.<br><br>Cycling had become the Bartali boys' passion, a flash of excitement and adventure in their tiny, workaday hometown. For Ponte a Ema in the 1920s was a sleepy place, just beyond the sophisticated world of Florence. Resting on the banks of the Ema, a tributary of the Arno River, Ponte a Ema brimmed with the vineyards, rolling hills, and waves of sweet lavender undulating out to the horizon, which have since made Tuscany world-renowned. Still, the village itself, located across a small bridge on the road from Florence to Bagno a Ripoli, looked like little more than an afterthought. One would be hard-pressed to find it on a map, hidden as it was some four miles southeast of Florence's central square. And though it included a short litany of establishments common to any small Italian town of the time--a church; a bank; a bike mechanic's shop; a simple barbershop; a grain mill; a small wine store; a five-room school set up in a farmer's house--it lacked a town hall and a proper piazza, the pulsing heart of Italian life where nonni, or grandparents, gather to play cards and stray cats dart out of the way of running children and bouncing soccer balls. Without a nucleus, Ponte a Ema conveyed the impression of an accidentally inhabited byway between more important places. That more important places existed would not occur to Gino until much later. Back then, Ponte a Ema was all the world a boy could want.<br><br>Born July 18, 1914, Gino Giovanni Bartali was a wispy, blue-eyed boy with a moppish head of curly dark hair. He lived with his parents, Torello and Giulia, his older sisters, Anita and Natalina, and his brother, Giulio, in one of the cream-colored, three-story tenement buildings that lined Via Chiantigiana, Ponte a Ema's main street, where all the hubbub of daily life played out. Like most of the apartments along Chiantigiana, the Bartalis' consisted of one room and a small kitchen. Home reminded Gino of Carlo Collodi's Pinocchio and the humble abode of Geppetto, the hot-headed Tuscan carpenter who was known for getting into scuffles with anyone who insulted him. "The furniture could not have been much simpler: a very old chair, a rickety old bed, and a tumble-down table," wrote Collodi. "Little as Geppetto's house was, it was neat and comfortable."<br><br>The Bartalis' home possessed a similar modest charm. The children helped Giulia cart jugs of water from nearby springs. Together with several families, the Bartalis shared a privy at the end of the hall on their floor, which consisted of a hole in a bench through which refuse dropped into a small container on the ground floor. Running water, like electricity, would only come several decades later, after the end of the Second World War.<br><br>These were cramped quarters to be sure, but Gino didn't know any different. Besides, outdoors was where the action was. Along the road, the boys from town would huddle for hours around a game of marbles, keeping a stern eye on the rainbow array of tiny glass globes that already belonged to them, and hawkishly watching the ones that would soon join their collection if luck and skill were on their side that day. The game was serious business for Gino and his friends, and almost always ended in a violent brawl, broken up only by the clatter of a pair of dark green window shutters being flung open above to make way for somebody's mother leaning out to deliver a strident scolding. Gino always got a particularly severe tongue-lashing when he came home for dinner covered in bruises. Thin and undersized, a cuff from another child was enough to topple him to the ground, but that did little to deter him from bounding up and swinging right back. Gino knew he was the weakest, but he hated being teased. "I would have liked to have friends who didn't take advantage of being stronger than me so that they could beat me up after every game of marbles," he said later. Already headstrong as a youngster, however, he was willing to stand up for himself, even if the outcome was rarely favorable. "I was an unlucky marbles player, and an even unluckier boxer."<br><br>When he and his friends would scatter into the surrounding fields for games of tag or cops and robbers, winning and losing was a more straightforward affair and fisticuffs could be kept to a minimum. The orchards outside town were ideal for any pastime that involved hiding and chasing, draped as they were with row upon row of rippling white washing hung out to dry. For Ponte a Ema was a laundry town; many of its villagers labored for small businesses charged with cleaning the linens and finery of Florence's gentlemanly class. Men organized the transportation for this industry, picking up and delivering laundry with a mule pulling a dray. Women, predictably, bore the brunt of the dirty work. With brushes and lye ash soap, they scrubbed soft mountains until they were spotless. They cleaned shirts in large cement basins called viaios; they rinsed large bedsheets on the banks of the Ema River, by the ponte or bridge for which the town was named. Once each stain had been painstakingly removed, everything was carried out to the orchards and hung to dry in endless bay-scented fabric corridors, perfect for dodging potential jailers or for lying in wait to snatch a slippery thief and triumphantly march him back to town, where his punishment would be determined and duly meted out.<br><br>"As children we had fun with little, in fact nothing," Gino said. They played murielle, a game that involved tiles and smoothed stones, in the small rectangular schoolyard, and diecone in the Ponte a Ema cemetery; whoever knocked down the most graveside candles by rolling coins at them won the ten-cent piece. They would sneak off to the Arno for a forbidden swim--the river was known for claiming lives with its currents and sudden whirlpools, and Gino's mother once had to resort to stealing her son's clothes from its banks, forcing him to scurry home naked, to teach him a lesson. Most days, though, Gino and his friends would scamper out of the water, get dressed, and, when somebody had a spare coin or two, run over to a riverside cookie factory that sold broken pieces of biscotti, with flavors like fig and sambuca, at an end-of-day discount.<br><br>Gino's favorite pastime was one he had to keep completely secret or risk an encounter with his father's leather belt. Torello's bicycle had always fascinated Gino and one day he hatched a plan to learn to ride atop it. It was far too big for a boy his size, but he was determined to master it. Like a bullfighter closing in on a bull in an arena, he approached it. Standing one foot on the left pedal, he slid his right leg under the crossbar to reach the right pedal. Balancing precariously, and much too short to sit on the bike seat, he stretched up to grip the handlebars from below. Crooked and wobbling, he learned painstakingly to maneuver the unwieldy contraption and barely noticed the smirks and giggles his clumsy expeditions elicited. He was too busy keeping his balance as he pedaled along Ponte a Ema's side streets.<br><br>Gino would have spent all of his waking hours outdoors at play if he could. Unfortunately, school was a constant interference. "I had little will to study," he said.<br><br>Gino's lack of discipline aggravated his father; his mother was irritated that her son had worn out more pairs of pants on the playground pavement than on the school benches where he was meant to be learning. Yet their lectures fell on deaf ears, and so a familiar scene began to play out regularly in the Bartali household.<br><br>"I don't like school, period," Gino would say.<br><br>"You are going and that's that," Torello would respond.<br><br>But Torello's persistence did not produce a scholar. Gino failed the first grade, and in the years that followed, the only charitable remark his teachers could muster about him as a student was that he had good personal hygiene. Still his father insisted he complete la sesta, the equivalent of sixth grade. Ponte a Ema's schoolhouse, however, only taught up to fifth grade--so Gino would have to travel to Florence to attend his final year. "To go to Florence you need a bicycle, and a bicycle costs money," Torello told his son. "You will have to earn it."<br>Like so many men of his era, Torello Bartali was the primary bread-winner of his family. Although his name meant "young bull" in Italian, Torello moved with the quiet ease of an old workhorse. The features of his face betrayed little about him. He always wore a beret, and a thick mustache covered the edges of his mouth, from which normally dangled a cigar. His physique was more revealing. Short and sinewy, he had a body of considerable strength.<br><br>Torello was used to hard work, but his job stability as a day laborer did little to inspire confidence. He worked principally in the fields, and when that type of job wasn't available, he worked in a local quarry, which mined the bluish shale used to pave the neighboring streets of Florence. When quarry work couldn't be found, Torello worked as a bricklayer, laying the foundation for countless Florentine homes. When both of those jobs were in short supply, he went down to the Arno River to collect sand that in turn was used for making cement. And as a last resort, he picked up work extinguishing the oil-fueled street lamps at dawn. For all his efforts, a laborer like Torello earned little more than the modern equivalent of about a dollar an hour.<br><br>Necessity forced Giulia to work as well, even if a woman's hourly wage in that era was often less than half a man's. In fact, money was so scarce in the Bartali household that Giulia barely made it home in time to give birth to Gino because she had hiked to a hillside convent that same morning to inquire about a maid's position. Like Torello, she toiled for long days in the fields, tending to the crops and the vines. Though she was small and sturdy, this heavy manual labor took its toll, and she was often plagued with severe leg pains. But Giulia was as ingenious as she was resilient. After particularly punishing days, she would soak a cloth in vinegar and salt, wring it out, and hold it against her legs for five minutes. For more severe pain, she rubbed a compress of wet cigar stubs over the sore areas until the pain subsided.<br><br>Primitive as they were, such remedies allowed Giulia to endure a workday that continued well after the sun set. After the long hours in the fields, Giulia spent her evenings earning extra money by embroidering, creating the kind of fine lacework found in the bridal trousseau of any Florentine woman of means. The work of running her household and feeding her husband and four children was balanced precariously atop her other labors. All of this added up to a hardscrabble life that paused only on Sundays, but it was hardly a unique one in Ponte a Ema or even the rest of Tuscany. In the early part of the twentieth century, Tuscan peasants worked an average of fourteen hours per day and a third more of the calendar year than Italians today.<br>Torello had already given Gino more than one dressing-down about the value of a lira. When Gino would meekly take his seat at the dinner table, hair tousled from his schoolyard scuffles, he knew he could expect the usual admonishment: "Money is necessary for food and certainly not for buying books for a boy who uses them to hit his friends over the head with." La sesta was fast approaching, and with it the need for transportation. Twelve-year-old Gino had to find a job. Though he and Giulio had helped their mother and sisters make embroidery for as long as they could remember (Gino was particularly skilled at making lace), his father believed it was time his elder boy found work of his own. Gino was too weak to begin apprenticing as a day laborer or bricklayer with his father, so Giulia decided to ask around for a simple and minimally strenuous position for her son. After some time, she found some farmers in a nearby town looking for a boy to help unravel piles of raffia, the long fibers from the leaves of certain palm trees, whose threads could be used to make ties for grapevines and delicate nursery plants. The work was easy enough, but for an energetic boy who longed to be outside with his friends, it was also an exercise in excruciating boredom. Only the promise of his very own bicycle kept Gino focused on the task at hand.<br><br>Consumed by his new goal, Gino was mesmerized by bikes wherever he saw them. But Ponte a Ema was not a worldly place. No races ever passed through town. The only groups of men cycling together that Gino saw were bricklayers on their way to work in Florence. They would ride by on their bicycles, many of them without pedals, which were too expensive to replace once broken. "A lot of time was still to pass before I set eyes on a sports paper and before I knew about the existence of a world in which you could go racing in a pair of black shorts and a colored jersey." Still, he kept working to earn money for his own bicycle, and in the meantime he snuck in rides on his father's, slowly acquainting himself with the vehicle that would change his life.<br>The bicycle had been born more than a century before Gino, but the earliest versions were little more than wooden horses mounted on wheels. In 1790 in Paris, a Frenchman rode one of these devices in a rudimentary race around the Champs-Elysees. In the late 1830s, a Scottish blacksmith named Kirkpatrick Macmillan experimented with building a hobby-horse with pedals so that a rider did not need to push off the ground to propel the machine forward. This pricey new amusement quickly became popular in North America. Oliver Wendell Holmes describes the years before the Civil War in the United States when "some of the Harvard College students who boarded in my neighborhood had these machines they called velocipedes, on which they used to waddle along like so many ducks."</p><h2>Haikyu!!, Vol. 3 (3)</h2><p>Ever since he saw the legendary player known as the "Little Giant" compete at the national volleyball finals, Shoyo Hinata has been aiming to be the best volleyball player ever!

The reception was divided and passionate. The book and show unabashedly forced the art world to deal with color photography, a medium scarcely taken seriously at the time, and with the vernacular content of a body of photographs that could have been but definitely weren't some average American's Instamatic pictures from the family album. These photographs heralded a new mastery of the use of color as an integral element of photographic composition. Bound in a textured cover inset with a photograph of a tricycle and stamped with yearbook-style gold lettering, the <i>Guide</i> contained 48 images edited down from 375 shot between 1969 and 1971 and displayed a deceptively casual, actually super-refined look at the surrounding world. Here are people, landscapes and odd little moments in and around Eggleston's hometown of Memphis--an anonymous woman in a loudly patterned dress and cat's eye glasses sitting, left leg slightly raised, on an equally loud outdoor sofa; a coal-fired barbecue shooting up flames, framed by a shiny silver tricycle, the curves of a gleaming black car fender, and someone's torso; a tiny, gray-haired lady in a faded, flowered housecoat, standing expectant, and dwarfed in the huge dark doorway of a mint-green room whose only visible furniture is a shaded lamp on an end table. For this edition of <i>William Eggleston's Guide</i>, The Museum of Modern Art has made new color separations from the original 35 mm slides, producing a facsimile edition in which the color will be freshly responsive to the photographer's intentions.</p><p>Born in 1937 in Memphis, Tennessee, William Eggleston works as a photographer in his home state and in Washington, D.C. He has been a lecturer in Visual and Environmental Studies at Harvard University, a researcher in color video at the Massachussetts Institute of Technology, and a recipient of grants from the Guggenheim Foundation, the National Endowment for the Arts, and the Arts Survey.</p><h2>Shadows in Flight (The Shadow Series, 5)</h2><p><p>Ender's Shadow explores the stars in this all-new novel...</p><p>At the end of <i>Shadow of the Giant</i>, Bean flees to the stars with three of his children--the three who share the engineered genes that gave him both hyper-intelligence and a short, cruel physical life.

A confession: I may have been the only reviewer who was not blown away by Maggie Shipstead's best-selling debut, <i>Seating Arrangements</i>. So this sophisticated, intelligent novel was an astonishing discovery. On one level, it tells a straightforward story, of a young woman in the 1970s who fought her way into the professional ballet world, helped her Russian dancer/sort-of boyfriend defect, and then left the ballet, married a &#x201c;civilian&#x201d; and raised a son who turned out to be ballet-obsessed. But it&#x2019;s also an insistent and deft look at passion and art, a book about growing up and facing your limits and getting on with life. That it&#x2019;s set in the dance world--an irresistible venue even for those of us who performed neither toe nor tap--is just the bonus to a novel that already hit the jackpot. <i>--Sara Nelson</i></p>Maggie Shipstead is a graduate of the Iowa Writers&#x2019; Workshop and a former Wallace Stegner Fellow at Stanford University.

The deserted curve of golden beach on the island in front of us glimmered in the sun as it sat nestled in its rocky cove. The crystal-clear turquoise water was making a lazy attempt at forming waves as it hit the sands, foaming elegantly like the froth on a cappuccino.<br> <br>Becalmed, I&#x2019;d thought, like me.<br> <br>We&#x2019;d dropped anchor in the small bay off the tiny Greek island of Macheres at sunset the night before, then waded ashore to the cove carrying two coolers. One was filled with fresh red mullet and sardines that Theo had caught earlier that day, the other with wine and water. I&#x2019;d set down my load on the sand, panting with effort, and Theo had kissed my nose tenderly.<br> <br>&#x201c;We are castaways on our very own desert island,&#x201d; he&#x2019;d announced, spreading his arms wide to gesture at the idyllic setting. &#x201c;Now I&#x2019;m off in search of firewood so we can cook our fish.&#x201d;<br> <br>I&#x2019;d watched him as he turned from me and walked toward the rocks forming a crescent around the cove, heading for the tinder-dry sparse bushes that grew in the crevices. Given he was a world-class sailor, his slight frame belied his strength. Compared to the other men I crewed with in sailing competitions who seemed to be all rippling muscles and Tarzan-like chests, Theo was positively diminutive. One of the first things I&#x2019;d noticed about him was his rather lopsided gait. He&#x2019;d since told me how he&#x2019;d broken his ankle falling out of a tree as a child and how it had never mended properly.<br> <br>&#x201c;I suppose it&#x2019;s another reason why I was always destined for a life on the water. When I&#x2019;m sailing, no one can tell how ridiculous I look walking on land,&#x201d; he&#x2019;d chuckled.<br> <br>We&#x2019;d cooked our fish and later made love under the stars. The following morning was our last aboard together. And just before I&#x2019;d decided I absolutely had to resume contact with the outside world by switching on my mobile, and then subsequently discovered my life had shattered into a million tiny pieces, I&#x2019;d lain there next to him perfectly at peace. And, like a surreal dream, my mind had replayed the miracle of Theo and me, and how we&#x2019;d come to be here in this beautiful place . . .<br> <br><br> <br>I&#x2019;d first set eyes on him a year or so ago at the Heineken Regatta in St. Maarten in the Caribbean. The winning crew was celebrating at the victory dinner and I was intrigued to discover that their skipper was Theo Falys-Kings. He was a celebrity in the sailing world, having steered more crews to victory in offshore races during the past five years than any other captain.<br> <br>&#x201c;He isn&#x2019;t what I imagined at all,&#x201d; I commented under my breath to Rob Bellamy, an old crewmate with whom I&#x2019;d sailed for the Swiss national team. &#x201c;He looks like a geek with those horn-rimmed glasses,&#x201d; I added as I watched him stand up to move across to another table, &#x201c;and he has a very odd walk.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s certainly not your average brawny sailor, admittedly,&#x201d; agreed Rob. &#x201c;But, Al, the guy is a total genius. He has a sixth sense when it comes to the water and there&#x2019;s no one I&#x2019;d trust more as my skipper on stormy seas.&#x201d;<br> <br>I was introduced to Theo briefly by Rob later that evening and I noticed his hazel-flecked green eyes were thoughtful as he shook my hand.<br> <br>&#x201c;So, you&#x2019;re the famous Al D&#x2019;Apli�se.&#x201d;<br> <br>Behind his British accent, his voice was warm and steady. &#x201c;Yes, to the latter part of that statement,&#x201d; I said, embarrassed at the compliment, &#x201c;but I think it&#x2019;s you who&#x2019;s famous.&#x201d; Doing my best not to let my gaze waver under his continued scrutiny, I saw his features soften as he let out a chuckle.<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s so funny?&#x201d; I demanded.<br> <br>&#x201c;To be frank, I wasn&#x2019;t expecting you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What do you mean me?&#x201d;<br> <br>Theo&#x2019;s attention was diverted by a photographer wanting a team photo, so I never did get to hear what it was he meant.<br> <br>After that, I began to notice him across the room at various social events for the regattas we took part in. He had an indefinable vibrancy about him and a soft, easy laugh that, despite his outwardly reserved demeanor, seemed to draw people to his side. If the event was formal, he was usually dressed in chinos and a crumpled linen jacket as a nod to protocol and the race sponsors, but his ancient deck shoes and unruly brown hair always made him look as if he&#x2019;d just stepped off a boat.<br> <br>On those first few occasions, it seemed as if we were dancing around each other. Our eyes met often, but Theo never attempted to continue our first conversation. It was only six weeks ago, when my crew had claimed victory in Antigua and we were celebrating at the Lord Nelson&#x2019;s Ball, which marked the end of race week, when he tapped me on the shoulder.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well done, Al,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Thanks,&#x201d; I replied, feeling gratified that our crew had beaten his for a change.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m hearing many good things about you this season, Al. Do you fancy coming to crew for me in the Cyclades Regatta in June?&#x201d;<br> <br>I&#x2019;d already been offered a place on another crew but had yet to accept. Theo saw my hesitation.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re already taken?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Provisionally, yes.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, here&#x2019;s my card. Have a think about it and let me know by the end of the week. I could really do with someone like you aboard.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Thanks.&#x201d; I mentally pushed aside my hesitation. Who on earth turned down the chance to crew for the man currently known as &#x201c;the King of the Seas&#x201d;? &#x201c;By the way,&#x201d; I called out as he began to walk away from me, &#x201c;last time we talked, why did you say you weren&#x2019;t expecting me?&#x201d;<br> <br>He paused, his eyes sweeping briefly over me. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d never met you in person; I&#x2019;d just heard tidbits of conversation about your sailing skills, that&#x2019;s all. And as I said, you aren&#x2019;t what I was expecting. Good night, Al.&#x201d;<br> <br>I mulled over our conversation as I walked back to my room in a little inn by St. John&#x2019;s harbor, letting the night air wash over me and wondering why it was that Theo fascinated me so much. Streetlights bathed the cheerful multicolored house fronts in a warm nocturnal glow, and from a distance, the lazy hum of people in the bars and caf�s drifted toward me. I was oblivious to it all, exhilarated as I was by the race win&#x2014;and by Theo Falys-Kings&#x2019;s offer.<br> <br>As soon as I entered my room, I made a beeline for my laptop and wrote him an e-mail to accept his offer. Before I sent it, I took a shower, then stopped to read it through again, blushing at how eager I sounded. Deciding to save it in my drafts folder and send it in a couple of days, I stretched out on my bed, flexing my arms to relieve the tension and soreness from the race that day.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, Al,&#x201d; I muttered to myself with a smile, &#x201c;that will be an interesting regatta.&#x201d;<br> <br>I sent the e-mail as planned and Theo contacted me immediately, saying how pleased he was I could join his crew. Then just two weeks ago, I&#x2019;d found myself inexplicably nervous as I stepped aboard the race-rigged Hanse 540 yacht in Naxos harbor to begin training for the Cyclades Regatta.<br> <br>The race was not overly demanding as competitive racing went, the entrants comprising a mix of serious sailors and weekend enthusiasts, all buoyed up by the prospect of eight days&#x2019; fabulous sailing between some of the most beautiful islands in the world. And as one of the more experienced crews involved, I knew we were strongly fancied to win.<br> <br>Theo&#x2019;s crews were always notoriously young. My friend Rob Bellamy and I, both thirty, were the &#x201c;senior&#x201d; members of the team in terms of age and experience. I&#x2019;d heard that Theo preferred to recruit talent in the early stages of a sailor&#x2019;s career to prevent bad habits. The rest of the crew of six were in their early twenties: Guy, a burly Englishman; Tim, a laid-back Aussie; and Mick, a half-German, half-Greek sailor who knew the waters of the Aegean like the back of his hand.<br> <br>Although I was eager to work with Theo, I hadn&#x2019;t stepped into it blindly; I&#x2019;d done my best beforehand to gather information on the enigma that was &#x201c;the King of the Seas&#x201d; by looking on the Internet and talking to those who had crewed with him previously.<br> <br>I&#x2019;d heard that he was British and had studied at Oxford, which would account for his clipped accent, but on the Internet, his profile said that he was an American citizen who had captained the Yale varsity sailing team to victory many times. One friend of mine had heard he came from a wealthy family, another that he lived on a boat.<br> <br>&#x201c;Perfectionist,&#x201d; &#x201c;Control freak,&#x201d; &#x201c;Hard to please,&#x201d; &#x201c;Workaholic,&#x201d; &#x201c;Misogynist&#x201d; . . . These were other comments I had gathered, the latter coming from a fellow female sailor who claimed she&#x2019;d been sidelined and mistreated on his crew, which did give me pause for thought. But the overwhelming sentiment was simple:<br> <br>&#x201c;Absolutely the best bloody skipper I have ever worked for.&#x201d;<br> <br>That first day aboard, I began to understand why Theo was afforded so much respect from his peers. I was used to shouty skippers who screamed instructions and abuse at one and all, like bad-tempered chefs in a kitchen. Theo&#x2019;s understated approach was a revelation. He said very little as he put us through our paces, just surveyed us all from a distance. When the day was over, he gathered us together and pinpointed our strengths and weaknesses in his calm, steady voice. I realized he&#x2019;d missed nothing, and his natural air of authority meant we hung on every word he said.<br> <br>&#x201c;And by the way, Guy, no more sneaking a cigarette during a practice under race conditions,&#x201d; he added with a half smile as he dismissed us all.<br> <br>Guy blushed to the roots of his blond hair. &#x201c;That guy must have eyes in the back of his head,&#x201d; he mumbled to me as we trooped off the boat to shower and change for dinner.<br> <br>That first evening, I headed out from our pension with the rest of the crew, feeling happy I&#x2019;d made the decision to join them in the race. We walked along Naxos&#x2019;s harbor front, the ancient stone castle lit up above the village and a jumble of twisting alleys winding down between the whitewashed houses. The restaurants along the front were teeming with sailors and tourists enjoying the fresh seafood and raising endless glasses of ouzo. We found a small family-run establishment in the back streets, with rickety wooden chairs and mismatched plates. The home-cooked food was just what we needed after a long day on the boat, the sea air giving us all a ravenous appetite.<br> <br>My obvious hunger elicited stares from the men as I tucked into the moussaka and generous helpings of rice. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s the problem? Have you never seen a woman eat before?&#x201d; I commented sarcastically as I leaned forward to grab another flatbread.<br> <br>Theo contributed to the banter with the occasional dry observation but left immediately after dinner, choosing not to participate in the post-supper bar crawl. I followed him shortly afterward. Over my years as a professional sailor, I&#x2019;d learned that the boys&#x2019; antics after dark were not something I wished to witness.<br> <br>In the next couple of days, under Theo&#x2019;s thoughtful green gaze, we began to pull together and quickly became a smoothly efficient team, and my admiration for his methods grew apace. On our third evening on Naxos, feeling particularly tired from a grueling day under the searing Aegean sun, I was the first to stand up from the dinner table.<br> <br>&#x201c;Right, lads, I&#x2019;m off.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Me too. Night, boys. No hangovers aboard tomorrow, please,&#x201d; Theo said, following me out of the restaurant. &#x201c;Can I join you?&#x201d; he asked as he caught up with me in the street outside.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, of course you can,&#x201d; I agreed, feeling suddenly tense that we were alone together for the first time.<br> <br>We walked back to our pension along the narrow cobbled streets, the moonlight illuminating the little white houses with their blue-painted doors and shutters on either side. I did my best to make conversation, but Theo only contributed the odd &#x201c;yes&#x201d; or &#x201c;no,&#x201d; and his taciturn responses began to irritate me.<br> <br>As we reached the lobby of the pension, he suddenly turned to me. &#x201c;You really are an instinctive seaman, Al. You beat most of your crewmates into a cocked hat. Who taught you?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;My father,&#x201d; I said, surprised by the compliment. &#x201c;He took me out sailing on Lake Geneva from when I was very small.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Ah, Geneva. That explains the French accent.&#x201d;<br> <br>I readied myself for the typical &#x201c;say something sexy in French&#x201d; type of comment that I usually got from men at this point, but it didn&#x2019;t come.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, your father must be one hell of a sailor&#x2014;he&#x2019;s done an excellent job on you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Thanks,&#x201d; I said, disarmed.<br> <br>&#x201c;How do you find being the only woman aboard? Although I&#x2019;m sure it&#x2019;s not a one-off occurrence for you,&#x201d; he added hastily.<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think about it, to be honest.&#x201d;<br> <br>He looked at me perceptively through his horn-rimmed glasses. &#x201c;Really? Well, forgive me for saying so, but I think you do. I feel you sometimes try to overcompensate for it and that&#x2019;s when you make errors. I&#x2019;d suggest you relax more and just be yourself. Anyway, good night.&#x201d; He gave me a brief smile, then mounted the white-tiled stairs to his room.<br> <br>That night, as I lay in the narrow bed, the starched white sheets itched against my skin and my cheeks burned at his criticism. Was it my fault that women were still a relative rarity&#x2014;or, as some of my male crewmates would undoubtedly say, a novelty&#x2014;aboard professional racing boats? And who did Theo Falys-Kings think he was?! Some kind of pop psychologist, going around analyzing people who didn&#x2019;t need to be analyzed?<br> <br>I&#x2019;d always thought I handled the woman-in-a-male-dominated-world thing well and had been able to take friendly jibes and asides about my female status on the chin. I&#x2019;d built myself a wall of inviolability in my career, and two different personas: &#x201c;Ally&#x201d; at home, &#x201c;Al&#x201d; at work. Yes, it was often hard and I&#x2019;d learned to hold my tongue, especially when the comments were of a pointedly sexist nature and alluded to my supposed &#x201c;blond&#x201d; behavior. I&#x2019;d always made a point of warding off such remarks by keeping my red-gold curls scraped back from my face and tied firmly in a ponytail, and by not wearing even a smidgen of makeup to accentuate my eyes or cover up my freckles. And I worked just as hard as any of the men on the boat&#x2014;perhaps, I fumed inwardly, harder.<br> <br>Then, still sleepless with indignation, I remembered my father telling me that much of the irritation people feel at personal observations is usually because there is a grain of truth in them. And as the night hours drew on, I had to concede that Theo was probably right. I wasn&#x2019;t being myself.<br> <br>The following evening, Theo joined me again as I walked back to the pension. For all his lack of physical stature, I found him hugely intimidating and I heard myself stumble over my words.

She&nbsp;lives and works in upstate New York.The Passenger Chapter 1<p></p> <br>WHEN I found my husband at the bottom of the stairs, I tried to resuscitate him before I ever considered disposing of the body. I pumped his barrel chest and blew into his purple lips. It was the first time in years that our lips had touched and I didn&#x2019;t recoil.<br> <br>I gave up after ten minutes. Frank Dubois was gone. Lying there all peaceful and quiet, he almost looked in slumber, but Frank was noisier asleep than he was awake. Honestly, if I had known what kind of snorer he was going to turn into, I never would have married him. If I could do it all over again, I never would have married him even if he slept like an angel. If I could do it all over again, there are so many things I would do differently. But looking at Frank then, so still and not talking, I didn&#x2019;t mind him so much. It seemed like a good time to say good-bye. I poured a shot of Frank&#x2019;s special bourbon, sat down on Frank&#x2019;s faux-suede La-Z-Boy, and had a drink to honor the dead.<br> <br>In case you were wondering, I didn&#x2019;t do it. I didn&#x2019;t have anything to do with Frank&#x2019;s death. I don&#x2019;t have an alibi, so you&#x2019;ll have to take my word for it. I was taking a shower when Frank died. As far as I could tell, he fell down the staircase all on his own. He had been suffering from vertigo lately. Convenient, I know. And I doubt he mentioned it to anyone. If I had waited for the police and told them the truth, maybe life could have continued as normal. Minus Frank.<br> <br>I poured another drink and contemplated my options. My first thought was to dispose of the body. Then I&#x2019;d tell the authorities that Frank left me for another woman. Or was running from a loan shark. It was well-known that he had a love for cards but no talent for it.<br> <br>I decided to test my strength to see if it was even possible. I tugged on Frank&#x2019;s bloated and callused feet, feet that I had come to loathe&#x2014;why do you have to tell a grown man to clip his toenails? I dragged the body about a foot from his landing site before I gave up. Frank had put on weight in the past year, but even if he were svelte I couldn&#x2019;t see depositing him anyplace where he&#x2019;d never be found. And now there was a suspicious trail of blood in the shape of a question mark just above his head. I might be able to explain it away if I called the police and stayed put. But then they&#x2019;d start looking at me real carefully and I didn&#x2019;t like people looking at me all that much.<br> <br>I tried to imagine my trial. Me, scrubbed clean, hair pulled back in a schoolmarm bun, wearing an innocent flowered sundress with a Peter Pan collar, trying to look not guilty, with my hard-edged poker face dry as the desert. I couldn&#x2019;t imagine how I&#x2019;d summon tears or sell that shattered look of loss. I can&#x2019;t show much emotion anymore. That was something Frank always liked about me. There was a time I used to cry, but that was another lifetime ago. My heart was broken just once. But completely.<br> <br>As I sat in Frank&#x2019;s chair, nursing my drink, I pretended to be weighing my options. But there was only one.<br> <br>Frank kept his gambling stash in his toolbox. A little over twelve hundred dollars. I packed for a short trip and loaded the suitcase into the back of Frank&#x2019;s Chevy pickup.<br> <br>I was only leaving two people behind, if you don&#x2019;t count Frank: Carol from the bar and Dr. Mike.<br> <br>Dr. Mike was the top chiropractor in Waterloo, Wisconsin. There were only two, so it wasn&#x2019;t much of a competition. He&#x2019;d taken over the practice three years ago, when Dr. Bill retired. Ever since the accident, my back hasn&#x2019;t been right. Dr. Bill used to fix me up once or twice a month. I saw Dr. Mike more frequently. The first time he put his hands on me, I felt an electric jolt, like I had woken up for the first time in years. I came back the next week and it was the exact same thing. I came back the week after that. I missed a week and Dr. Mike dropped by the bar to see how I was doing. Frank was on a fishing trip and Dr. Mike offered to give me an adjustment in the back office. It didn&#x2019;t go as planned.<br> <br>I couldn&#x2019;t trouble Carol at this hour. I&#x2019;d wake her kids. Maybe I&#x2019;d send her a postcard from the road.<br> <br>My chiropractor worked out of an office on the first floor of his three-story Queen Anne&#x2013;style house in the nice part of town. The smart thing to do was to get out now, run during those precious hours when the world thought Frank was still in it. But I had few real connections to this world, and Dr. Mike was one of them.<br> <br>I drove Frank&#x2019;s Chevy truck to Dr. Mike&#x2019;s house and took the key from under the rock. I unlocked the door and entered his bedroom. Dr. Mike made a purring sound when he was in a deep sleep, just like a Siamese cat I had as a child. He kind of moved like one, too. He always stretched his lanky limbs upon waking, alternating between slow and deliberate, and fast and sharp. I took off my clothes and climbed into bed next to him.<br> <br>Dr. Mike woke up, wrapping his arms around me.<br> <br>&#x201c;Do you need an adjustment?&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Uh-huh.&#x201d;<br> <br>That was our little joke. He kissed my neck and then my lips and he turned onto his back, waiting for me to start. That was his thing; we never did it unless it was my decision. I had started it, I&#x2019;d continue it, and today I was ending it.<br> <br>Dr. Mike and I were never a great love story. He was the place I went to when I wanted to forget. When I was with Dr. Mike I forgot about Frank, I forgot about running from the law, I forgot about who I used to be.<br> <br>When we were done, Mike was massaging the kinks out of my back and trying to straighten out my spine.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re completely out of alignment. Did something happen? Did you do something you shouldn&#x2019;t have?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Probably,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>Dr. Mike turned me over on my back and said, &#x201c;Something has changed.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s about time, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d;<br> <br>I&#x2019;d felt like a speck of dust frozen in an ice cube for far too long. I should have done something about this life I had long before Dead Frank made me do something.<br> <br>I looked at the clock; it was just past midnight. Time to leave. I got dressed quickly.<br> <br>Dr. Mike studied me with a professional regard. &#x201c;This is the end, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d;<br> <br>I don&#x2019;t know how he knew, but he did. There was no point in answering the question.<br> <br>&#x201c;In the next few days, you might hear some things about me. I just want you to know that they&#x2019;re not true. Later, it&#x2019;s possible you&#x2019;ll hear more things about me. Most of them won&#x2019;t be true either,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>I kissed him good-bye for the last time.<br> <br>I DROVE thirty miles before I gassed up the truck. I had one ATM card and one credit card and withdrew the $200 maximum for each. I drove another twenty miles to the next fuel stop, got a strong cup of coffee, and withdrew another two hundred on each card. Frank had always been stingy with our money. I had one credit card and a small bank account and neither provided sufficient funds to set you up, if you decided to take an extended vacation. I made one more stop at a Quick Mart, got another four hundred dollars, and dropped the cards in the Dumpster out back. I had $2,400 and a Chevy truck that I&#x2019;d have to lose before long. I should have been tucking money away from the moment I got the key to the cash register. I should have known this day would come.<br> <br>The truck smelled like my husband&#x2014;my ex-husband? Or was I a widow? I&#x2019;d have to decide. I guess I could have never married. Either way, I drove with the windows open, trying to lose the scent of Frank.<br> <br>I merged onto I-39 South, leaving Wisconsin behind. I drove through Illinois for some time until I saw a sign for I-80, which I knew would take me somewhere. I had no destination in mind, so I headed west, mostly because I didn&#x2019;t feel like squinting against the morning light. And I planned on driving through dawn.<br> <br>I hadn&#x2019;t brought music for the drive, so I was stuck with local radio and preachers all night long. I hooked onto a station while speeding along the rolling hills of Iowa. It was too dark to see the denuded trees and murky snow marring the barren February landscape.<br> <br>The Iowa preacher who kept me company for the first half of my journey was listing the seven signs of the Antichrist. One was that he&#x2019;d appear Christlike. I listened through the static of the fading station and noted a few more clues. He&#x2019;d be handsome and charming. He was sounding like a catch. But then I lost reception. So it&#x2019;s quite possible I&#x2019;ll run into the Antichrist and never know it.<br> <br>I toggled through the stations to another minister preaching about forgiveness. It&#x2019;s a subject that doesn&#x2019;t interest me. I switched off the radio and drove to the sound of wind swishing by and wheels on asphalt while headlights of people on a different path blinked and vanished in my peripheral vision.<br> <br>I remembered the day I met Frank. I had only been in town a few weeks, hoping to land work somewhere. I was drinking at his bar, which was named after him. Dubois&#x2019;. Sometimes I think I married Frank for his name. I never liked Tanya Pitts. Didn&#x2019;t like the first name, didn&#x2019;t like the last name. No doubt, Tanya Dubois was a promotion.<br> <br>Back then, Frank had some life in him and I had none, so it worked out just fine. He gave me my first real job. I learned how to pull pints and mix drinks, although we didn&#x2019;t get too many requests for cocktails in our humble establishment. There wasn&#x2019;t much more to my life with Frank. We didn&#x2019;t have any children. I made sure of that.<br> <br>After driving all night, I found myself just outside Lincoln, Nebraska. It was time to take a break and lose the truck. I found a used car dealership and traded in Frank&#x2019;s two-year-old Chevy Silverado for a seven-year-old Buick Regal and seventeen hundred in cash. I knew I was being fleeced, but it was better not to draw attention to myself. I wouldn&#x2019;t be keeping the Buick for long, anyway. I drove another ten miles to a small town called Milford and found a motel called Motel that looked like the kind of establishment that wouldn&#x2019;t mind an all-cash transaction. When they asked for ID, I said I&#x2019;d lost mine. I paid a surcharge and signed the register as Jane Green.<br> <br>I slept for eight solid hours. If I were guilty, could I have done that? I woke with a hunger so fierce it had turned to nausea. I opened the door of room 14, on the second story of the stucco building, and leaned over the balcony to catch a glimpse of the town where I&#x2019;d landed. I don&#x2019;t think that balcony was up to code. I took a step back, spotted an unlit red neon sign for DINER.<br> <br>I returned to my room, washed up, and headed out, giving myself a quick reminder: You are Jane Green for now. Forget who you used to be.<br> <br>It was eight in the evening, well past the dinner crowd, so I took a seat in a booth, figuring the counter is where everyone talks. I probably wouldn&#x2019;t be very good at that, since I had no identity. That would come later.<br> <br>A waitress named Carla dropped a menu in front of me.<br> <br>&#x201c;Can I start you off with anything?&#x201d; she asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Coffee,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Black.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Try it first; then decide.&#x201d; She poured the coffee. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll give you a minute to look over the menu.&#x201d;<br> <br>She was right. It wasn&#x2019;t the kind of coffee you drank straight. I drowned it in cream and sugar. Even then it was hard to keep down. I perused the menu, trying to decide what I was in the mood for. It occurred to me that Jane Green might be in the mood for something different than Tanya Dubois. But since I hadn&#x2019;t yet changed my clothes or my hair, I could probably last another day eating the food that Tanya liked. Jane Green was just a shell I embodied before I could be reborn.<br> <br>&#x201c;Have you decided, sweetheart?&#x201d; Carla asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Apple pie and French fries,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>&#x201c;A girl after my own heart,&#x201d; Carla said, swiftly walking away on her practical white nurse&#x2019;s shoes.<br> <br>I watched Carla chat with a trucker who was hunched over a plate of meatloaf at the end of the counter. He grumbled something I couldn&#x2019;t understand.<br> <br>Carla squinted with a determined earnestness and said, &#x201c;Sunshine, I think you need to go on antidepressants. Yes indeed, you need a happy pill. The next time you walk into my house I want to see a smile on that handsome face of yours. Do you hear me? See that sign there? We have the right to refuse service.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Carla, leave the poor man alone,&#x201d; some guy in the kitchen yelled.<br> <br>&#x201c;Mind your own business, Duke,&#x201d; Carla said. Then she filled more cups of coffee, called customers honey and sweetheart, and belly-laughed at a joke that wasn&#x2019;t funny at all. I thought it would be nice to be Carla, maybe just for a little while. Try her on and see if she fit.<br> <br>I devoured my pie and French fries so quickly even Carla was impressed.<br> <br>&#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t seen three-hundred-pound truckers put food away that fast. You must have been famished.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; I said. Short answers. Always.<br> <br>I paid the check and left, walking down the dull drag of the small town, which hardly deserved a name. I walked into a drugstore and purchased shampoo, a toothbrush, toothpaste, hair dye in auburn and dark brown, and a disposable cell phone from behind the counter.<br> <br>The clerk, a middle-aged man with the name Gordon on his name tag, rang up my order and said, &#x201c;That&#x2019;ll be fifty-eight dollars and thirty-four cents.&#x201d;<br> <br>I paid in cash. As I was leaving, the following words escaped my mouth: &#x201c;Thanks, sweetheart. Have a nice day.&#x201d;<br> <br>It felt so wrong, I almost shivered in embarrassment.<br> <br>I FOUND a liquor store on the way home and purchased a bottle of Frank&#x2019;s favorite bourbon. I figured I could drink away all my memories. I paid in cash and said a mere &#x201c;thanks&#x201d; to the clerk.<br> <br>Back in the hotel room, with the heating unit rattling out of time, I spread my bounty on the bed and tried to decide my next move. I&#x2019;d known it all along, but I didn&#x2019;t yet have the courage. I took a shot of bourbon and plucked my phone book from my purse. I inhaled and practiced saying hello a few times. Then I dialed.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oliver and Mead Construction,&#x201d; the receptionist said.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d like to speak to Mr. Roland Oliver.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;May I ask who is calling?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No. But I&#x2019;m sure he&#x2019;ll want to talk to me.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Please hold.&#x201d;<br> <br>A click, and then Beethoven blasted over the line. Two full minutes passed and the receptionist returned.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m afraid Mr. Oliver is very busy right now. Can I take a number, and he&#x2019;ll call you back?&#x201d;<br> <br>I didn&#x2019;t want to say the name, but I didn&#x2019;t see any other way of reaching him.<br> <br>&#x201c;Tell Mr. Oliver that his old friend Tanya is calling.&#x201d;<br> <br>This time I got only a few bars of Beethoven before Mr. Oliver&#x2019;s deep sandpaper voice came on the line.<br> <br>&#x201c;Who is this?&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Tanya Pitts,&#x201d; I whispered.<br> <br>He said nothing. I could hear his labored breath.<br> <br>&#x201c;I need your help,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>&#x201c;You shouldn&#x2019;t have called me here,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Would it have been better if I left a message with your wife?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What do you want?&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>&#x201c;A favor.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What kind of favor?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I need a new name.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong with the one you&#x2019;ve got?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not working for me anymore. I think you know someone who can take care of these things.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I might.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I want a clean identity, a name that&#x2019;s prettier than my old one, and if possible, I wouldn&#x2019;t mind being a few years younger.&#x201d; Tanya Dubois was about to have her thirtieth birthday. But I didn&#x2019;t want to turn thirty before my time.<br> <br>&#x201c;You can&#x2019;t get identities served to order,&#x201d; Mr. Oliver said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Do your best.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;How can I reach you?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll reach you. Oh, and if you wouldn&#x2019;t mind, I...</p><h2>Marriage Matters</h2><p><p><i>&#x201c;Most people today view marriage as a means of looking for love, happiness, and fulfillment. </i><i>Make no mistake about it, those things are important.

John Boessenecker now restores this incredible Ranger to his proper place alongside such fabled lawmen as Wyatt Earp and Eliot Ness. Here is a grand adventure story, told with grace and authority by a master historian of American law enforcement. Frank Hamer can rest easy as readers will finally learn the truth behind his amazing career, spanning the end of the Wild West through the bloody days of the gangsters.&#x201d; <br>--Paul Andrew Hutton, author of <i>The Apache Wars</i></p><p>To most Americans, Frank Hamer is known only as the &#x201c;villain&#x201d; of the 1967 film <i>Bonnie and Clyde. </i>Now, in <i>Texas Ranger, </i>historian John Boessenecker sets out to restore Hamer&#x2019;s good name and prove that he was, in fact, a classic American hero. </p><p>From the horseback days of the Old West through the gangster days of the 1930s, Hamer stood on the frontlines of some of the most important and exciting periods in American history. He participated in the Bandit War of 1915, survived the climactic gunfight in the last blood feud of the Old West, battled the Mexican Revolution&#x2019;s spillover across the border, protected African Americans from lynch mobs and the Ku Klux Klan, and ran down gangsters, bootleggers, and Communists. When at last his career came to an end, it was only when he ran up against another legendary Texan: Lyndon B. Johnson.</p><p>Written by one of the most acclaimed historians of the Old West, <i>Texas Ranger </i>is the first biography to tell the full story of this near-mythic lawman.</p></p><p>JOHN BOESSENECKER, a San Francisco trial lawyer and former police officer, is considered one of the leading authorities on crime and law enforcement in the Old West. He is the award-winning author of <i>Bandido: The Life and Times of Tiburcio Vasquez</i>. In 2011 and 2013, <i>True West</i> magazine named Boessenecker Best Nonfiction Writer. He has appeared frequently as a historical commentator on PBS, The History Channel, A&amp;E, and other networks.<p>Praise for <i>Texas Ranger</i></p><p>"In terms of sheer action and violence, from close-quarters gunfights to Mexican-border ambushes to face-offs with lynch mobs, I&#x2019;m hard-pressed to think of [a biography of an American lawman and detective] that rivals John Boessenecker&#x2019;s excellent 'Texas Ranger'... a notable achievement" - <i><b>Wall Street Journal</b></i></p><p>"Fair-minded and thorough... �Boesse�necker tells the gruesome story with power and force." - <b><i>New York Times Book Review</i></b></p><p>"The author&#x2019;s painstaking research...brings forth an astounding story....

John Boessenecker has written the definitive biography of a lawman who did way more than rid the nation of Bonnie and Clyde."<b>&#x2015;</b><b><i>Mike Cox, author of</i> <i>Wearing the Cinco Peso: The Texas Rangers 1821-1900 and Time of the Rangers: Texas Rangers from 1900 to the Present</i></b></p><p>&#x201c;<i>Texas Ranger</i> should be required reading for students of Ranger history. John Boessenecker follows the career of legendary Texas Ranger Frank Hamer from the horseback days of the Old West through battles with bootleggers and gangsters in the 1930s. The level of original research here is apparent and Boessenecker leaves no stone unturned in his sleuthing of Hamer's past and his 52 gun battles. This is an action-packed story that does not read like a traditional biography.&#x201d; <b>&#x2015;</b><i><b>Stephen L.

Then, much like the man about whom he's writing, Boessenecker proceeds to back up what he says. Writing in clear, fast-moving prose and bolstered by meticulous research, Boessenecker tells the story of Frank Hamer's life and reveals that there was much more to it than simply being the man who tracked down Bonnie and Clyde. As a Texas Ranger, city marshal, range detective, special investigator, and other law enforcement positions, Hamer battled bandits, lynch mobs, revolutionaries, gunrunners, bootleggers, gangsters, and crooked politicians. Boessenecker spins this epic tale with great skill and without neglecting Hamer's mistakes and shortcomings, so that <i>Texas Ranger</i> is a fully realized portrait of a complex but admirable man.

To do this, Dr. Ahlskog offers a gold mine of information, distilled from his years of experience treating people with Parkinson's at the Mayo Clinic. In addition to providing a comprehensive account of Parkinson's medications, this book also examines additional aspects of treatment, such as the role of nutrition, exercise, and physical therapy.<br>Although many commendable texts have been written on the subject of Parkinson's Disease, their discussions of treatment have not been in depth.

'Be a partner, not a patient' is an admonition that is particularly constructive in optimizing the interactions between patients with Parkinson's disease and their caregivers. In order to be an effective partner, it is essential that patients and their caregivers develop a basic, core understanding of the diagnosis, treatment, course, and likely complications of the disease. A careful reading of The Parkinson's Disease Treatment Book is a substantial first step for patients in assuming full partnership."--G. Frederick Wooten, M.D., Chairman of the Scientific Advisory Board, American Parkinson Disease Association <br><p></p><br>"Dr. Ahlskog, one of the top specialists in Parkinson's disease, has put down in this wonderful book up-to-date information on all aspects of Parkinson's disease as well as his extensive experience and wisdom gained by caring for, and especially caring about, people with Parkinson's disease for over two decades. It is filled with practical information and written in a style that is sophisticated enough to be useful but at the same time easily understandable by people with Parkinson's disease, their friends, and their families. As information is one of the most potent therapies for people dealing with Parkinson's disease, this book represents a major treatment breakthrough."--Stephen G. Reich, M.D., Associate Professor, Department of Neurology, The University of Maryland School of Medicine <br><p></p><br>"Dr. Ahlskog has provided a remarkably readable and immensely useful book on the treatment of Parkinson's disease, addressed to patients and their caregivers. He lays out a wise approach to this complex and multifaceted disease which comes from many years of his own personal experience. What shines through is his very special sensitivity to his patients and a lucid understanding of their needs. All aspects of the disease are covered.... Special attention is paid to the many non-motor problems that are all too often neglected in the treatment of patients such as anxiety, depression, sleep disorders, sexuality issues, and problems with bladder, bowel, and blood pressure regulation. Most importantly, many of the myths and ill-conceived notions surrounding the treatment of Parkinson's disease are met head on and convincingly dispelled."--Daniel Tarsy, M.D., Chief, Parkinson's Disease and Movement Disorders Center, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center <br><p></p><br>"Dr. Ahlskog has again produced a uniquely informative, focused, and readable treatise on Parkinson's disease. Unlike many other guides for Parkinson's patients, this one doesn't attempt to present the entire confusing universe of disparate management options, but rather presents the well-informed opinions of a single seasoned and highly respected practitioner. Virtually every rational question that a patient might pose is addressed here using scientifically correct, but eminently understandable language. Parkinson's disease patients, their care-givers, and their physicians will all benefit from this treasure trove of clinical wisdom." -Robert Rodnitzky, MD, Director of the Division of Movement Disorders, University of Iowa Carver College of Medicine<p></p><br>"Dr. Eric Ahlskog from the Mayo Clinic is the leading authority on Parkinson's disease. With over thirty years of experience treating Parkinson's disease patients, Dr. Ahlskog shares his expertise on treating all of the possible symptoms that a patient may encounter in the different stages of PD. His advice is direct and understandable. Patients and caregivers will turn to this book again and again over the years to answer their questions and use the information to better partner with their healthcare providers in achieving the best possible outcome. I will recommend this book to all of my patients as the main source for learning about the disease and the available treatment options." -Kevin J. Klos, MD, Movement Disorder Clinic of Oklahoma<p></p><br>"Hundreds of questions will arise during the course of Parkinson's disease regarding diagnosis, symptoms, and treatment options. Dr. Ahlskog draws on his decades of neurological practice to lay out information that answers just about all of these questions. Information is power, and the well-informed patient is in the best position to navigate this condition. The book can be read cover to cover, or the reader can turn to the topic of interest and find explanations delivered in a conversational style. Many of my patients use the first edition as a guide, and are eagerly awaiting this updated version." -Padraig O'Suilleabhain, MD, Associate Professor of Neurology and Neurotherapeutics, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center<p></p><br>"Dr. Ahlskog has written a go-to text: straight forward, down-to-earth, and eminently readable. With his PhD focused on pharmacology, and his many years of research and clinical experience as a neurologist and a director of the Mayo Clinic's PD program, there is no one I trust more than Eric. Unlike others in the field, he has never compromised himself to the fashion of the day. I recommend this book wholeheartedly to professionals, patients, and their families." -Bradley C. Hiner, MD, Professor of Neurology, Medical College of Wisconsin and Neurologic Director, Deep Brain Stimulation Program<p></p><br>"This is a valuable resource for anyone affected by Parkinson's disease.

Pronghorn antelope, gray wolves, bison, coyotes, wild horses, and grizzly bears: less than two hundred years ago these creatures existed in such abundance that John James Audubon was moved to write, "it is impossible to describe or even conceive the vast multitudes of these animals."<br><br>In a work that is at once a lyrical evocation of that lost splendor and a detailed natural history of these charismatic species of the historic Great Plains, veteran naturalist and outdoorsman Dan Flores draws a vivid portrait of each of these animals in their glory--and tells the harrowing story of what happened to them at the hands of market hunters and ranchers and ultimately a federal killing program in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The Great Plains with its wildlife intact dazzled Americans and Europeans alike, prompting numerous literary tributes. <i>American Serengeti</i> takes its place alongside these celebratory works, showing us the grazers and predators of the plains against the vast opalescent distances, the blue mountains shimmering on the horizon, the great rippling tracts of yellowed grasslands. Far from the empty "flyover country" of recent times, this landscape is alive with a complex ecology at least 20,000 years old--a continental patrimony whose wonders may not be entirely lost, as recent efforts hold out hope of partial restoration of these historic species.<br><br>Written by an author who has done breakthrough work on the histories of several of these animals--including bison, wild horses, and coyotes--<i>American Serengeti</i> is as rigorous in its research as it is intimate in its sense of wonder--the most deeply informed, closely observed view we have of the Great Plains' wild heritage.</p></p><p>Dan Flores is A.

Panache Desai offers a refreshing, surprisingly unusual approach to meet the challenges of the modern moment and heal the fractured self it produces.</p><p>For Desai, the soul&#x2014;whole, unbroken, at peace, and one with the life source&#x2014;isn&#x2019;t a destination. It already exists within each of us, just waiting to be revealed. It is not something we have to work to develop&#x2014;it is our birthright. And when we are in union with our soul, we experience a personal evolution that not only illuminates our individual cosmic purpose but helps us to engage the sense of purpose and presence necessary to remake the world itself.</p><p><em>You Are Enough</em> offers a straightforward, non-judgmental, and approachable process of revealing the soul, of coming into alignment and harmony with our true selves. Combining personal narrative, clear and inspiring philosophy, and prescriptive practices, it reveals that the way through is the way in&#x2014;that the way through fear, self-doubt, and anxiety is accepting and embracing dissonance and emotional and psychological blockages, so that we can approach our lives and the world from a perspective that understands our fears are not who we are.

Beep! Sheep in a jeep on a hill that's steep." </i></blockquote> This story, much like the jeep, gathers momentum from page one. When five foolish sheep cram into one jeep, their high spirits and occasional lack of foresight (like forgetting to steer) combine to make a riotous, if ill-fated, road trip. Plummeting over a hill, tumbling into a mud puddle, yelping for help, these muttonheads just can't get their act together, much to the delight of young readers.<p> Nancy Shaw's Seussian rhymes are guaranteed to tickle every reader's funny bone, while providing a great little learning tool, as well. Who wouldn't want to learn how to read, after hearing lines like this: "Jeep goes splash! Jeep goes thud! Jeep goes deep in gooey mud!" Well-loved illustrator Margot Apple humorously captures the dopey expressions and preposterous predicaments of Shaw's sheep. More wild and woolly misadventures can be found in any of Shaw and Apple's other sheepish titles, including <i>Sheep on a Ship</i> and <i>Sheep Take a Hike</i>. (Ages 2 to 7) <i>--Emilie Coulter</i></p><p>Nancy Shaw is the author of eight beloved tales featuring the endearing and comical sheep.

Worse still, Mara, beloved daughter of Urthstripe, Badger Lord of the Fire Mountain, is in terrible danger. Then a lightning bolt uncovers the sword of Martin the Warrior, and young Samkin embarks on an adventure that leads him to Mara. Can the good creatures triumph over the villainous Assassin? <br><br> Illustrated by Gary Chalk</p><p>As the inhabitants of Redwall relax in the haze of the long, hot summer, they are unaware that the neighboring stronghold of Salamandastron lies besieged by the evil weasel army of Ferhago the Assassin. Nor do they realize that Mara, beloved daughter of Urthsipe, Badger Lord of the Fire Mountain, is in terrible danger. But when a lightening bolt uncovers the sword of Martin the Warrior, young Samkin embarks on adventure that leads him to Mara, and their lives become inextricably entwined. <p> Brian Jacques once again strikes to the heart in this stunningly executed adventure, another in the best-selling Redwall series, proving, if indeed proof was needed, that he ranks high among the best children's authors in the world. His genius lies in his ability to capture character and atmosphere with a stroke of a pen, drawing the reader in until the only way to start breathing again is to finish the book. <i>--Susan Harrison</i></p><b>Brian Jacques</b>&nbsp;was born in Liverpool, England on June 15th, 1939. Along with forty percent of the population of Liverpool, his ancestral roots are in Ireland.&nbsp;A well-known radio personality in his native Liverpool--as well as an actor, stand-up comic, and playwright--Brian was the host of "Jakestown" on BBC Radio Merseyside. Ever the performer, Jacques applied his acting and entertainment background to his lively presentations to legions of young fans at schools across the United States and England.<br><br>His interest in adventure stories began at an early age with reading the books of: Daniel Defoe, Sir Henry Rider Haggard, Arthur Conan Doyle, Sir Thomas Malory, Robert Michael Ballantyne, Robert Louis Stevenson, Edgar Rice Burroughs, and Kenneth Grahame. He attended St. John's School, an inner city school that had its playground on the roof. On his first day at St. John's, at the age of ten, he had an experience that marked his potential as a writer. When given an assignment of writing a story about animals, he wrote about the bird that cleaned a crocodile's teeth. The teacher could not, and would not, believe that a ten year old could write that well. When young Brian refused to falsely say that he had copied the story, he was caned as "a liar". He had always loved to write, but it was only then, that he realized that he had a talent for writing.<br><br>Some teachers at St. John's proved to be good role models.&nbsp;This interest in poetry extended to Wordsworth, Tennyson, and Goldsmith. It was also at St. John's that Brian met a teacher, Alan Durband (who also taught two Beatles, Paul McCartney and George Harrison), who, more than thirty years later would bring about a major change in his life.<br><br>After Brian finished school at fifteen, he set out to find adventure as a merchant seaman. He travelled to many far away ports, including New York, Valparaiso, San Francisco, and Yokohama. Tiring of the lonely life of a sailor, he returned to Liverpool where he worked as a railway fireman, a longshoreman, a long-distance truck driver, a bus driver, a boxer, a bobby (Police Constable 216D), a postmaster, and a stand-up comic.<br>&nbsp;<br><b>Penguin mourns the passing of celebrated children&#x2019;s book author Brian Jacques</b></p><h2>Maximized Manhood Workbook: A Guide to Family Survival (Majoring in Men)</h2><p><b>A Real Man Masters Maximized Living</b><p>Maximize your life, as millions of men have worldwide, by studying the Christian classi<i>c&nbsp;Maximized Manhood</i>!

Boyer provides a wide-ranging and authoritative history of America, capturing in a compact space the full story of our nation. Ranging from the earliest Native American settlers to the presidency of Barack Obama, this <em>Very Short Introduction</em> offers an illuminating account of politics, diplomacy, and war as well as the full spectrum of social, cultural, and scientific developments that shaped our country. <br><br>Here is a masterful picture of America's achievements and failures, large-scale socio-historical forces, and pivotal events. Boyer sheds light on the colonial era, the Revolution and the birth of the new nation; slavery and the Civil War; Reconstruction and the Gilded Age; the Progressive era, the Roaring Twenties and the Great Depression; the two world wars and the Cold War that followed; right up to the tragedy of 9/11, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the epoch-making election of Barack Obama. Certain broad trends shape much of the narrative--immigration, urbanization, slavery, continental expansion, the global projection of U.S. power, the centrality of religion, the progression from an agrarian to an industrial to a post-industrial economic order. Yet in underscoring such large themes, Boyer also highlights the diversity of the American experience, the importance of individual actors, and the crucial role of race, ethnicity, gender, and social class in shaping the contours of specific groups within the nation's larger tapestry. And along the way, he touches upon the cultural milestones of American history, from Tom Paine's <em>The Crisis</em> to Allen Ginsberg's <em>Howl</em>.<br><br><em>American History: A Very Short Introduction</em> is a panoramic history of the United States, one that covers virtually every topic of importance--and yet can be read in a single day.<br></p><p><br><strong>Paul S. Boyer</strong> was Merle Curti Professor of History Emeritus at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. A leading authority on American history, his writings span the social origins of the Salem witchcraft outbreak to the cultural impact of the atomic bomb and the political implications of Bible prophecy belief in contemporary America. A history textbook author and editor of reference works, including <em>The Oxford Companion to United States History</em>, he published in many general-interest periodicals. He also appeared on PBS, BBC, the History Channel, and the Discovery Channel, and lectured at some 100 colleges and universities in the United States, Germany, Great Britain, Ireland, Scandinavia, and Switzerland.<br><br>"Paul Boyer, a scholar's scholar and a teacher's teacher, has here encompassed the entirety of American history in an account that testifies on every page to his lifetime of deep and thoughtful learning, and to his remarkable powers of synthesis, concision, balance, and trenchantly lucid writing."--David M.

Explore the nature of the physical body and learn how to prepare yourself to become a medium. Experience for yourself the trance state, clairvoyance, psychometry, table tipping, levitation, talking boards, automatic writing, spiritual photography, spiritual healing, distant healing, channeling, and development circles. Also learn how to avoid spiritual fraud.</p> <p>This revised and expanded edition of Buckland's popular <em>Doors to Other Worlds</em> has over one hundred new pages, including a completely new chapter on electronic spirit contact. It features additional photographs and illustrations, an index, a new preface, and a workbook format with study questions and answers for each chapter.</p></p><p><p>Raymond Buckland was actively involved in metaphysics and the occult for fifty years. <br> <br>He was the author of more than sixty books, including such best-selling titles as <em>Buckland's Complete Book of Witchcraft</em>, <em>Gypsy Dream Dictionary</em>, <em>Practical Candleburning Rituals</em>, and <em>Witchcraft from the Inside</em>. Ray lectured and presented workshops across the United States, and appeared on major television and radio shows nationally and internationally. He also wrote screen plays, was a technical advisor for films, and appeared in films and videos. <br> <br>Ray came from an English Romany (Gypsy) family and resided with his wife Tara on a small farm in central Ohio. Beyond writing, Ray's other passion was homebuilt airplanes. </p><p><strong>Lesson One: What is Mediumship? <br><strong>Beginnings </strong></strong><br>In some of my books I have spoken of the earliest beginnings of religiomagic and described the probable actions of Paleolithic peoples in their attempts to communicate with deity. Certainly we know that the earliest humans needed success in hunting in order to survive and, from extant cave paintings, carvings, and clay models, we know that "magic" was performed immediately before their all-important hunts.We also know from these sources that humankind called upon deity to bring success to this magic, thereby making these hunts fruitful.</p> <p>From the painting known as "The Sorcerer" in the Caverne des Trois Fr�res, in Ari�ge, France (see page 2), it can be seen that a member of the tribe would dress in the skins of a stag and wear the mask and horns, or antlers, of the animal&#x2015;playing the role of the God of Hunting&#x2015;in order to lead a ritual designed to bring success to the hunt that would follow. As part of his role, the person playing the part of the Hunting God would almost certainly have spoken as that deity, directing the hunters in their pantomimed actions. So what he might well have been doing, whether or not he realized it, was "channeling" the deity; actually allowing the Hunting God to speak through him.</p> <p><strong>Channeling <br></strong>Channeling is a phenomenon that has become popular in recent years, with any number of people publicly going into trance and allowing "entities" to speak through them to their audiences. In public halls, on television, on video tapes, these channelers can be seen and heard. Though not claiming to be a plenipotentiary for "God," many of them do claim that they are bringing the voice, and the teachings, of an entity who has never previously lived on this earth but who dwells, or has dwelled, on some far distant planet or even in some other dimension. (I'll speak more on this in lesson 15.)</p> <p>Channeling can be found throughout the ages; from those early cave-dwelling days continuously through to present-day examples. The ancient Egyptian priests would frequently play the part of one or another of their many gods and goddesses. Once again we have extant examples of the paraphernalia used (for example, the mask worn when representing Anubis, the jackal-headed god). The sibyls of ancient Greece were regularly consulted by a populace who desired to speak with their deities.</p> <p>The Romans, too, had their soothsayers and seers, who passed on the words of the dwellers on Mount Olympus. In the Mayan temples the priests played the part of their gods, giving or relaying instructions and advice to the people. In the Bible, in 1 Corinthians 12 and 14, there are exhortations for all to use their gifts of prophesy and other spiritual gifts. Throughout the Middle Ages it was common to consult with those who had access to the land beyond death through the rituals of necromancy. In eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Haiti, the slaves developed their own form of religion to produce Voodoo, a combination of their native African beliefs and practices, mixed in with those of the indigenous Indians, and with what they saw as the power of the Catholic Church. In Voodoo, the sole purpose of many of the gatherings is to speak to the deities, who "appear" by possessing one or another of the worshippers and speaking through them. In modern-day Panchmuda, India (northwest of Calcutta), similar rites are held each year at the Temple of Manasa for the Snake Festival, when the Serpent Mother takes possession of her worshippers. Writers, musicians, and artists have long composed through a process of channeling.</p> <p>Wolfgang Mozart heard music in his head and simply wrote down what he heard, never changing or modifying it. In the mid-nineteenth century came the birth of the present-day Spiritualist movement, with the Fox sisters of New York, in 1848, discovering a simple method to communicate with the spirits of the dead (see lesson 3).</p> <p>A medium is a connecting link between this physical world and the world of spirit. Anyone can learn to act as that link. Anyone can become a medium.</p> <p><strong>Lady Ann M. Burdock <br></strong>It can be seen, then, that there is nothing new in channeling, be it bringing messages from those who have died and passed on, producing advice from extraterrestrial entities, or speaking the words of divinities. The channel is a medium through which the information is produced. (What that information is, how accurate it may be, and from whence it comes, are questions we will address later in this book.) Anyone can act as such a channel, or medium. Some people seem more readily attuned to the position than others, but we all have the capability. Most mediums and channels work consciously and have, indeed, spent time in training to achieve their results, yet some act completely spontaneously and unconsciously.</p> <p><strong>Possession <br></strong>Mediumship is not the same thing as possession. In possession an undesirable spirit or entity takes over the body of a living human, forcing out and overriding that human's spirit. It possesses and refuses to give up possession unless driven out...though there are actually far fewer cases of true possession than late-night movies and the sensational media would have you believe. In mediumship the living human may voluntarily allow another spirit to make use of his or her vocal cords, hand and/or arm muscles, or other parts of the body; but never giving up total control of the entire body...it is a mutual agreement that can be terminated at any time. Under the proper circumstances there is absolutely no harm that can come to the medium, though it may be wise to use some precautionary measures "just in case." These I'll deal with, in detail, elsewhere.</p> <p>In many types of mediumship, however, there is no giving up of any of the medium's organism whatsoever. For example, with clairvoyance and clairaudience the medium is simply seeing and hearing and then relaying what he or she sees or hears. It is only in such forms as direct voice, automatic writing, and the like that there is ever any degree of use of the medium's body.</p> <p>In this book I will be dealing mainly with mediumship in the sense of obtaining information from the spirits of those who have died and passed on but, toward the end of the book, I'll also look into channeling of other entities. Throughout the book I'll address developing your own abilities in the various aspects of mediumship. Here practice will be the keyword.</p> <p>But with practice, one thing needs to be borne in mind: don't overdo things. Don't try to do something&#x2015;be it crystal-gazing, clairvoyance, or psychometry&#x2015;and keep trying till you are blue in the face! Apart from getting discouraged, you'll rapidly terminate your interest in that specific art, and perhaps the whole field of mediumship, and you'll drag down your psychic defenses to the point where you could suffer both physically and emotionally. It is much better to take small bites on a regular basis; then you'll progress, gain in strength, and much sooner reach the goals you have set for yourself.</p> <p><strong>Exercises <br></strong>At the root of all psychic development is good breathing. In my book <em>Amazing Secrets of the Psychic World </em>(coauthored with Hereward Carrington), I spoke of the life-giving property of fresh air and the fact that simply by breathing fully you contribute to living fully. Some of the exercises I gave were:</p> <ol> <li>Stand before an open window, or out of doors, free from all restrictive clothing. Exhale forcibly, bending the body forward and relaxing the muscles. Then stand up straight and place both hands over your abdomen. Now breathe as deeply as possible against those hands, expanding the abdomen as much as possible without allowing the chest or ribs to expand at all.Again exhale forcibly.</li> <li>After five or six such breaths, place your hands on either side against your ribs. Now breathe in deeply, pressing out the ribs but without allowing either the abdomen or the upper chest to expand more than a little.</li> <li>After five or six breaths, place your hands on your upper chest, just below the neck, and breathe with this portion of the lungs, without allowing either the ribs or the abdomen to expand.</li> <li>You will find that it's not so easy to control your breathing. After you have mastered it, however, you can go on to the next step, the complete breath.</li> <li>Take a number of good, deep breaths, starting with expanding your abdomen, then the ribs, then the upper chest, one after the other in the one breath. Try to control this intake in the three stages, one after the other. Then, as you become more accomplished, merge them one into the next so that you have something akin to a rolling motion as the breath moves up the body. Breathe in through your nose and out through either your nose or mouth. From there continue with establishing a mental image of the breath as you breathe it, in the form of light. See it coming into your body and filling it. As you breathe out, see the light forcing out all the negativity in the form of dark colors: black, dark browns, greens, and reds. You can imagine the light entering from wherever seems most comfortable to you&#x2015;through the third eye; into the heart; up from the ground through your feet...whichever you prefer. Just be consistent and always see it entering at the same place. For the exit of the negativity, see it being driven out of all your bodily orifices, one after the other, and end with it leaving through all the pores of the skin. End with the whole body&#x2015;every little extremity&#x2015;completely filled with fresh, vibrant, positive light.</li> </ol> <p><strong>Trance Development and Chakra Enhancement<br></strong>Analyze your "falling asleep" pattern. Try to catch yourself at just the point of falling asleep and to "hold on to yourself," as it were, as long as possible &gt;in that state until you can hold no more and you actually do fall asleep. This is excellent practice so that you will always be in control of yourself, no matter how deep the trance you enter.</p> <p>Spirits do not belong perpetually to the same order. All are destined to attain perfection by passing through the different degrees of the spirithierarchy. This amelioration is effected by incarnation</p> <p><strong>Allan Kardec <br></strong>The physical body is connected to the etheric or spiritual body at centers known as chakras (pronounced "shock-ruz"). Part of the development of any psychic and spiritual ability is to stimulate those chakras by raising what is known as the kundalini power&#x2015;power that travels through the body and generates energy. The chakras are linked with actual physical glands, and there are seven of them. The first, lumbar (or base) chakra, is at the gonads; the second, spine chakra, is at the adrenals; the solar plexus chakra is at the lyden; the heart chakra is at the thymus; the throat chakra is at the thyroid; the third eye chakra is at the pineal, and the crown chakra is at the pituitary. Here is what I say about chakras and kundalini in my book <em>Buckland's Complete Book ofWitchcraft </em>(Llewellyn, 2002):</p> <blockquote>"In meditation the mysterious psychic energy can be sent up through these centers. This very potent force is called the kundalini, or "Serpent Power." As this mighty force begins to flow within you, these vital psychic centers&#x2015;the chakras&#x2015;begin to open in successive order. As the vital forces begin to flow through the nervous system, the individual achieves a sense of well-being and peace. The subconscious begins to clear itself of the negative and undesired patterns of feelings and images that have been programmed into it through your lifetime. The cosmic force of the kundalini very naturally operates in a calm, relaxed, contemplative atmosphere. As the succession of opening chakras continues, your awareness and perception of life flows continually from within. A new vibrancy permeates your being."</blockquote> <p><strong>Exercise <br></strong>Getting the kundalini power to flow through the chakras very definitely sets up a new vibrancy. But how to get that power to flow? The first step is to do your deep breathing, as in the exercises above, then to awaken the chakras as follows.</p> <p>Each of the seven centers is associated with a color, going through the spectrum. The base chakra is red, the spine chakra is orange, the solar plexus chakra is yellow, the heart chakra is green, the throat chakra is blue, the pineal chakra is indigo, and the crown chakra is violet. Imagine each of these centers, one at a time, and see it enveloped in its specific color.</p></p><h2>Traction: How Any Startup Can Achieve Explosive Customer Growth</h2><p><p><b>Most startups don&#x2019;t fail because they can&#x2019;t build a product. <br>Most startups fail because they can&#x2019;t get traction.&nbsp;</b><br><br>Startup advice tends to be a lot of platitudes repackaged with new buzzwords, but <i>Traction </i>is something else entirely. <br>&nbsp;<br>As Gabriel Weinberg and Justin Mares learned from their own experiences, building a successful company is hard.

It was a strange company for many reasons, not the least of which was that we had no employees from beginning to end. I wrote every line of code and did all the accounting and customer support.</p><p>The terms of the deal were such that my cofounder and I didn&#x2019;t have to work for the acquiring company at all. We were free to move on to other things, and we did. A few months later my wife and I moved from our 865-square-foot apartment near Boston to a country house twenty-five miles outside of Philadelphia. I had just turned twenty-seven.</p><p>She went to her job and I sat at home doing nothing for the first time in my life. We knew no one for a hundred miles in any direction.</p><p>Naturally, I started tinkering on the computer again, starting about a dozen side projects simultaneously. A year and a half later, I thought I was on to something. I noticed two things that bothered me about Google: too much spam (all those sites with nothing but ads) and not enough instant answers (I kept going to Wikipedia and IMDb). I thought if I could easily pick out the spam and the answers, then I&#x2019;d have a more compelling search engine.</p><p>Both problems were harder to solve than I initially thought, but I thoroughly enjoyed the work and kept at it. Everyone I talked to about my search engine project thought I was nuts. You&#x2019;re doing what? Competing against Google? Why? How? Another year later, in the fall of 2008, I flipped the switch, unveiling my search engine to the public.</p><p>DuckDuckGo had a rather uneventful launch, if you can even call it a launch. I posted it to a niche tech site called <i>Hacker News</i> and that was the long and short of it. The post was entitled &#x201c;What do you think of my new search engine?&#x201d;</p><p>Like many entrepreneurs, I&#x2019;m motivated by being on the cusp of something big, and I was at the point where I needed some validation. I can survive on little, but I needed something.</p><p>I got it.</p><p>Granted, the product wasn&#x2019;t anything you&#x2019;d want to switch to at that point, and people let me know that. It was an Internet forum, after all. However, I still felt there was genuine interest in a new search competitor. I could tell some people were growing wary of what Google was becoming. For example, those initial conversations led me to investigate search privacy and eventually become &#x201c;the search engine that doesn&#x2019;t track you,&#x201d; years before government and corporate surveillance became a mainstream issue.</p><p>In any case, the response I received was enough motivation to keep me going. Which brings me to traction. I needed some.</p><p>Traction is the best way to improve your chances of startup success. Traction is a sign that something is working. If you charge for your product, it means customers are buying. If your product is free, it&#x2019;s a growing user base.</p><p>Traction is powerful. Technical, market, and team risks are easier to address with traction. Fund-raising, hiring, press, partnerships, and acquisitions all become much easier.</p><p>In other words, <i>traction trumps everything</i>.</p><p>My last startup had grown using two traction channels: first, search engine optimization (ranking high in search engines for relevant terms), and later, viral marketing (where your customers bring in other customers, such as by referring friends and family through use of the product).</p><p>Viral marketing doesn&#x2019;t work well in search because you can&#x2019;t easily bake it into the product by putting stuff between people and their search results. So I tried search engine optimization. The terms &#x201c;search engine&#x201d; and &#x201c;search engines&#x201d; were too hard to rank for, as the high-ranking companies had been around for a decade and had tens of thousands of links pointing at them from their long histories. &#x201c;New search engine&#x201d; was more in my grasp.</p><p>I worked hard for many months to rank high for this phrase. The key to good search engine optimization (SEO) is getting links. As you will read later in the SEO chapter, you need a strategy to get these links in a scalable way.</p><p>Getting stories written about you in blogs and news outlets is a common SEO linking strategy. However, I hit saturation with that channel strategy pretty quickly and it didn&#x2019;t get me to the top. Something more creative was required.</p><p>After much brainstorming and experimenting, I eventually hit upon a good idea. I built a karma widget that would display links to your social media profiles and how many followers you had on each service. People would embed it on their sites and at the bottom there would be a link back to DuckDuckGo that said &#x201c;new search engine.&#x201d;</p><p>This channel strategy worked beautifully. I was number one.</p><p>Trouble was, not a ton of people make that search&#x2014;about fifty a day. So while I did get some traction and a steady stream of new users, it leveled off pretty quickly. It wasn&#x2019;t enough traction to be meaningful. It didn&#x2019;t move the needle.</p><p>I made two large traction mistakes here. First, I failed to have a concrete traction goal. In retrospect, to move the needle for my traction goals at the time, I needed more like five thousand new visitors a day, not fifty. Search engine optimization was not going to get me there.</p><p>Second, I was biased by my previous experience. Just because my last company got traction in this way didn&#x2019;t mean it was right for every company.</p><p>These are very natural mistakes to make. In fact, most startups make them. The most common startup trajectory now goes something like the following:</p><p>Founders have an idea for a company they&#x2019;re excited about. Initial excitement turns into a struggle to build a product, but they do get something out the door.</p><p>Launch!</p><p>The founders expected customers to beat a path to their door, but unfortunately that isn&#x2019;t happening. Getting traction was an afterthought, but now they are focused on it. They try what they know or what they&#x2019;ve heard others do: some Facebook ads, a little local PR, and maybe a smattering of blog posts.</p><p>Then they run out of money and the company dies.</p><p>Sadly, this is the norm. Even sadder, often these products are actually on to something. That is, with the right traction strategy they might have actually been able to get traction and not go out of business.</p><p>Given my previous startup success I thought I knew what I was doing. I was wrong. Luckily, I wasn&#x2019;t dead wrong. I had the money to self-fund through my traction mistakes, and so they didn&#x2019;t prove fatal for DuckDuckGo. Not everyone is as lucky.</p><p>Right when I realized I was making these mistakes I also realized I didn&#x2019;t know the right way to go about getting traction at all. I asked around. It turns out there was no good framework for getting traction, and that&#x2019;s how this book was born, way back in 2009.</p><p>Around this time I also started angel investing and more seriously advising other startups. I saw firsthand similar struggles and mistakes. I also partnered with Justin Mares, my coauthor. Justin founded two startups (one of which was acquired) and recently ran growth at Exceptional Cloud Services, which was acquired by Rackspace in 2013 for millions. He&#x2019;s a growth expert in his own right.</p><p>We set out to help startups get traction no matter what business they were in: from Internet companies to local small businesses and everything in between. We drew on our personal experiences, interviewed more than forty founders, studied many more companies, and pulled out the repeatable framework they used to succeed.</p><p>That framework is Bullseye, a simple three-step process for getting traction. Bullseye works for startups of all kinds: consumer or enterprise focused, large or small.</p><p>Since DuckDuckGo&#x2019;s humble beginnings, we have grown five orders of magnitude (10x growth spurts), from that initial one hundred searches a day to now over ten million a day. Each step&#x2014;from 100 to 1,000, 10,000 to 100,000, 1,000,000 to 10,000,000&#x2014;involved figuring out how to get traction again. That&#x2019;s because, as you will see, often what works in one growth stage eventually stops working.</p><p>Thankfully we had Bullseye to help us find the right traction channel strategy at the right time. After my search engine optimization mistake, we shifted to using content marketing, social and display ads, publicity, and most recently business development. We&#x2019;ve hit the bull&#x2019;s-eye repeatedly, and so can you.</p><p></p><p></p><p>CHAPTER ONE</p><p>Traction Channels</p><p>Before we get started, let&#x2019;s define traction. Traction is a sign that your company is taking off. It&#x2019;s obvious in your core metrics: If you have a mobile app, your download rate is growing rapidly. If you&#x2019;re running a subscription service, your monthly revenue is skyrocketing. If you&#x2019;re an organic bakery, your number of transactions is increasing every week. You get the point.</p><p>Naval Ravikant, founder of AngelList, an online platform that helps companies raise money, says it well:</p><p><i>Traction is basically quantitative evidence of customer demand. So if you&#x2019;re in enterprise software, [initial traction] may be two or three early customers who are paying a bit; if you&#x2019;re in consumer software the bar might be as high as hundreds of thousands of users.</i></p><p>You can always get more traction. The whole point of a startup is to grow rapidly. Getting traction means moving your growth curve up and to the right as best you can. Paul Graham, founder of startup accelerator Y Combinator, puts it like this:</p><p><i>A startup is a company designed to grow fast. Being newly founded does not in itself make a company a startup. Nor is it necessary for a startup to work on technology, or take venture funding, or have some sort of &#x201c;exit.&#x201d; The only essential thing is growth. Everything else we associate with startups follows from growth.</i></p><p>Traction is growth. The pursuit of traction is what defines a startup.</p><p>After interviewing more than forty successful founders and researching countless more, we discovered that startups get traction through <i>nineteen different channels</i>. Many successful startups experimented with multiple channels until they found one that worked.</p><p>We call these customer acquisition channels <i>traction channels</i>. These are marketing and distribution channels through which your startup can get traction: real customer growth.</p><p>We uncovered two broad themes through our research. First, most founders consider using only traction channels with which they&#x2019;re already familiar, or those they think they should be using because of their type of product or company. This means that far too many startups focus on the same channels and ignore other promising ways to get traction. In fact, often the most underutilized channels in an industry are the most promising ones.</p><p>Second, it&#x2019;s hard to predict the traction channel that will work best. You can make educated guesses, but until you start running tests, it&#x2019;s difficult to tell which channel is the best one for you right now.</p><p>Our introductory chapters 2&#x2013;5 expand on these themes. Chapter 2 introduces you to traction thinking: the mind-set you need to adopt to maximize your chances of getting traction. Chapter 3 presents our framework for getting traction called Bullseye. Essentially, it involves targeted experimentation with a few traction channels, followed by laser focus on the core channel that is most promising.</p><p>Chapter 4 explains how to go about running traction tests, a central theme of Bullseye. Chapter 5 presents a second framework&#x2014;called Critical Path&#x2014;to help you focus on the right traction goal and ignore everything else not required to achieve it.</p><p>Before you jump into this material, however, we&#x2019;d like to introduce you to the nineteen traction channels and some of the people we interviewed for them. We will explore each of these channels in chapters 6&#x2013;24.</p><p>When going through the traction channels, try your best not to dismiss them as irrelevant for your company. Each traction channel has worked for startups of all kinds and phases. As mentioned, the right channel is often an underutilized one. Get one channel working that your competitors dismiss, and you can grow rapidly while they languish.</p><p>Targeting Blogs</p><p>Popular startups like Codecademy, Mint, and reddit all got their start by targeting blogs. Noah Kagan, Mint&#x2019;s former director of marketing, told us how he targeted niche blogs early on, and how this strategy allowed Mint to acquire forty thousand customers before launching.</p><p>Publicity</p><p>Publicity is the art of getting your name out there via traditional media outlets like newspapers, magazines, and TV. We interviewed Jason Kincaid, former <i>TechCrunch</i> writer, about pitching media outlets, how to form relationships with reporters, and what most startups do wrong when it comes to publicity. We also talked with Ryan Holiday, media strategist and bestselling author of <i>Trust Me, I&#x2019;m Lying</i>, to learn how startups could leverage today&#x2019;s rapidly changing media landscape to get traction.</p><p>Unconventional PR</p><p>Unconventional PR involves doing something exceptional like publicity stunts to draw media attention. This channel can also work by repeatedly going above and beyond for your customers. Alexis Ohanian told us some of the things he did to get people talking about reddit and Hipmunk, two startups he cofounded.</p><p>Search Engine Marketing</p><p>Search engine marketing (SEM) allows companies to advertise to consumers searching on Google and other search engines. We interviewed Matthew Monahan of Inflection, the company behind Archives.com (before its $100 million acquisition by Ancestry.com), to learn how Archives relied primarily on SEM for its growth.</p><p>Social and Display Ads</p><p>Ads on popular sites like reddit, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, and hundreds of other niche sites can be a powerful and scalable way to reach new customers. We brought in Nikhil Sethi, founder of the social ad buying platform Adaptly, to talk with us about getting traction with social and display ads.</p><p>Offline Ads</p><p>Offline ads include TV spots, radio commercials, billboards, infomercials, newspaper and magazine ads, as well as flyers and other local advertisements. These ads reach demographics that are harder to target online, like seniors, less tech-savvy consumers, and commuters. Few startups use this channel, which means there&#x2019;s less competition for many of these audiences. We talked with Jason Cohen, founder of WP Engine and Smart Bear Software, about the offline ads he&#x2019;s used to acquire customers.</p><p>Search Engine Optimization</p><p>Search engine optimization (SEO) is the process of making sure your Web site shows up for key search results. We interviewed Rand Fishkin of Moz (the market leader in SEO software) to talk about best practices for getting traction with SEO. Patrick McKenzie, founder of Appointment Reminder, also explained to us how he uses SEO to cheaply acquire lots of highly targeted traffic.</p><p>Content Marketing</p><p>Many startups have blogs. However, most don&#x2019;t use their blogs to get traction. We talked with Unbounce founder Rick Perreault and OkCupid cofounder Sam Yagan to learn how their blogs transformed their businesses.</p><p>Email Marketing</p><p>Email mark...</p></p><h2>A Walk Across America</h2><p><p><strong>Twenty-five years ago, a disillusioned young man set out on a walk across America. This is the book he wrote about that journey -- a classic account of the reawakening of his faith in himself and his country.</strong></p><p>"I started out searching for myself and my country," Peter Jenkins writes, "and found both." In this timeless classic, Jenkins describes how disillusionment with society in the 1970s drove him out onto the road on a walk across America. His experiences remain as sharp and telling today as they were twenty-five years ago -- from the timeless secrets of life, learned from a mountain-dwelling hermit, to the stir he caused by staying with a black family in North Carolina, to his hours of intense labor in Southern mills. Many, many miles later, he learned lessons about his country and himself that resonate to this day -- and will inspire a new generation to get out, hit the road and explore.</p></p><p>g Jenkins' book is the next best thing to having actually walked along beside him."

That night, the newspapers printed a picture of his office, with an unfinished manuscript on his desk. The caption read that the greatest scientist of our era could not finish his greatest masterpiece. What, I asked myself, could be so difficult that such a great scientist could not finish it? What could possibly be that complicated and that important? To me, eventually this became more fascinating than any murder mystery, more intriguing than any adventure story. I had to know what was in that unfinished manuscript.<br><br> Later, I found out that the name of this scientist was Albert Einstein and the unfinished manuscript was to be his crowning achievement, his attempt to create a &#x201c;theory of everything,&#x201d; an equation, perhaps no more than one inch wide, that would unlock the secrets of the universe and perhaps allow him to &#x201c;read the mind of God.&#x201d;<br><br> But the other pivotal experience from my childhood was when I watched the Saturday morning TV shows, especially the <i>Flash Gordon</i> series with Buster Crabbe. Every week, my nose was glued to the TV screen. I was magically transported to a mysterious world of space aliens, starships, ray gun battles, underwater cities, and monsters. I was hooked. This was my first exposure to the world of the future. Ever since, I&#x2019;ve felt a childlike wonder when pondering the future.<br><br> But after watching every episode of the series, I began to realize that although Flash got all the accolades, it was the scientist Dr. Zarkov who actually made the series work. He invented the rocket ship, the invisibility shield, the power source for the city in the sky, etc. Without the scientist, there is no future. The handsome and the beautiful may earn the admiration of society, but all the wondrous inventions of the future are a by--product of the unsung, anonymous scientists.<br><br> Later, when I was in high school, I decided to follow in the footsteps of these great scientists and put some of my learning to the test. I wanted to be part of this great revolution that I knew would change the world. I decided to build an atom smasher. I asked my mother for permission to build a 2.3-million electron volt particle accelerator in the garage. She was a bit startled but gave me the okay. Then, I went to Westinghouse and Varian Associates, got 400 pounds of transformer steel, 22 miles of copper wire, and assembled a betatron accelerator in my mom&#x2019;s garage.<br><br> Previously, I had built a cloud chamber with a powerful magnetic field and photographed tracks of antimatter. But photographing antimatter was not enough. My goal now was to produce a beam of antimatter. The atom smasher&#x2019;s magnetic coils successfully produced a huge 10,000 gauss magnetic field (about 20,000 times the earth&#x2019;s magnetic field, which would in principle be enough to rip a hammer right out of your hand). The machine soaked up 6 kilowatts of power, draining all the electricity my house could provide. When I turned on the machine, I frequently blew out all the fuses in the house. (My poor mother must have wondered why she could not have a son who played football instead.)<br><br> So two passions have intrigued me my entire life: the desire to understand all the physical laws of the universe in a single coherent theory and the desire to see the future. Eventually, I realized that these two passions were actually complementary. The key to understanding the future is to grasp the fundamental laws of nature and then apply them to the inventions, machines, and therapies that will redefine our civilization far into the future.<br><br> There have been, I found out, numerous attempts to predict the future, many useful and insightful. However, they were mainly written by historians, sociologists, science fiction writers, and &#x201c;futurists,&#x201d; that is, outsiders who are predicting the world of science without a firsthand knowledge of the science itself. The scientists, the insiders who are actually creating the future in their laboratories, are too busy making breakthroughs to have time to write books about the future for the public.<br><br> That is why this book is different. I hope this book will give an insider&#x2019;s perspective on what miraculous discoveries await us and provide the most authentic, authoritative look into the world of 2100.<br><br> Of course, it is impossible to predict the future with complete accuracy. The best one can do, I feel, is to tap into the minds of the scientists at the cutting edge of research, who are doing the yeoman&#x2019;s work of inventing the future. They are the ones who are creating the devices, inventions, and therapies that will revolutionize civilization. And this book is their story. I have had the opportunity to sit in the front-row seat of this great revolution, having interviewed more than 300 of the world&#x2019;s top scientists, thinkers, and dreamers for national TV and radio. I have also taken TV crews into their laboratories to film the prototypes of the remarkable devices that will change our future. It has been a rare honor to have hosted numerous science specials for BBC--TV, the Discovery Channel, and the Science Channel, profiling the remarkable inventions and discoveries of the visionaries who are daring to create the future. Being free to pursue my work on string theory and to eavesdrop on the cutting--edge research that will revolutionize this century, I feel I have one of the most desirable jobs in science. It is my childhood dream come true.<br><br> But this book differs from my previous ones. In books like <i>Beyond Einstein, Hyperspace,</i> and <i>Parallel Worlds,</i> I discussed the fresh, revolutionary winds sweeping through my field, theoretical physics, that are opening up new ways to understand the universe. In <i>Physics of the Impossible,</i> I discussed how the latest discoveries in physics may eventually make possible even the most imaginative schemes of science fiction.<br><br> This book most closely resembles my book <i>Visions,</i> in which I discussed how science will evolve in the coming decades. I am gratified that many of the predictions made in that book are being realized today on schedule. The accuracy of my book, to a large degree, has depended on the wisdom and foresight of the many scientists I interviewed for it.<br><br> But this book takes a much more expansive view of the future, discussing the technologies that may mature in 100 years, that will ultimately determine the fate of humanity. How we negotiate the challenges and opportunities of the next 100 years will determine the ultimate trajectory of the human race.<br><br> <i><br><br></i><b>PREDICTING THE NEXT CENTURY</b> <br><br> Predicting the next few years, let alone a century into the future, is a daunting task. Yet it is one that challenges us to dream about technologies we believe will one day alter the fate of humanity.<br><br> In 1863, the great novelist Jules Verne undertook perhaps his most ambitious project. He wrote a prophetic novel, called <i>Paris in the Twentieth Century,</i> in which he applied the full power of his enormous talents to forecast the coming century. Unfortunately, the manuscript was lost in the mist of time, until his great--grandson accidentally stumbled upon it lying in a safe where it had been carefully locked away for almost 130 years. Realizing what a treasure he had found, he arranged to have it published in 1994, and it became a best seller.<br><br> Back in 1863, kings and emperors still ruled ancient empires, with impoverished peasants performing backbreaking work toiling in the fields. The United States was consumed by a ruinous civil war that would almost tear the country apart, and steam power was just beginning to revolutionize the world. But Verne predicted that Paris in 1960 would have glass skyscrapers, air conditioning, TV, elevators, high--speed trains, gasoline--powered automobiles, fax machines, and even something resembling the Internet. With uncanny accuracy, Verne depicted life in modern Paris.<br><br> This was not a fluke, because just a few years later he made another spectacular prediction. In 1865, he wrote <i>From the Earth to the Moon,</i> in which he predicted the details of the mission that sent our astronauts to the moon more than 100 years later in 1969. He accurately predicted the size of the space capsule to within a few percent, the location of the launch site in Florida not far from Cape Canaveral, the number of astronauts on the mission, the length of time the voyage would last, the weightlessness that the astronauts would experience, and the final splashdown in the ocean. (The only major mistake was that he used gunpowder, rather than rocket fuel, to take his astronauts to the moon. But liquid-fueled rockets wouldn&#x2019;t be invented for another seventy years.)<br><br> How was Jules Verne able to predict 100 years into the future with such breathtaking accuracy? His biographers have noted that, although Verne was not a scientist himself, he constantly sought out scientists, peppering them with questions about their visions of the future. He amassed a vast archive summarizing the great scientific discoveries of his time. Verne, more than others, realized that science was the engine shaking the foundations of civilization, propelling it into a new century with unexpected marvels and miracles. The key to Verne&#x2019;s vision and profound insights was his grasp of the power of science to revolutionize society.<br><br> Another great prophet of technology was Leonardo da Vinci, painter, thinker, and visionary. In the late 1400s, he drew beautiful, accurate diagrams of machines that would one day fill the skies: sketches of parachutes, helicopters, hang gliders, and even airplanes. Remarkably, many of his inventions would have flown. (His flying machines, however, needed one more ingredient: at least a 1-horsepower motor, something that would not be available for another 400 years.)<br><br> What is equally astonishing is that Leonardo sketched the blueprint for a mechanical adding machine, which was perhaps 150 years ahead of its time. In 1967, a misplaced manuscript was reanalyzed, revealing his idea for an adding machine with thirteen digital wheels. If one turned a crank, the gears inside turned in sequence performing the arithmetic calculations. (The machine was built in 1968 and it worked.)<br><br> In addition, in the 1950s another manuscript was uncovered which contained a sketch for a warrior automaton, wearing German--Italian armor, that could sit up and move its arms, neck, and jaw. It, too, was subsequently built and found to work.<br><br> Like Jules Verne, Leonardo was able to get profound insights into the future by consulting a handful of forward--thinking individuals of his time. He was part of a small circle of people who were at the forefront of innovation. In addition, Leonardo was always experimenting, building, and sketching models, a key attribute of anyone who wants to translate thinking into reality.<br><br> Given the enormous, prophetic insights of Verne and Leonardo da Vinci, we ask the question: Is it possible to predict the world of 2100? In the tradition of Verne and Leonardo, this book will closely examine the work of the leading scientists who are building prototypes of the technologies that will change our future. This book is not a work of fiction, a by--product of the overheated imagination of a Hollywood scriptwriter, but rather is based on the solid science being conducted in major laboratories around the world today.<br><br> The prototypes of all these technologies already exist. As William Gibson, the author of <i>Neuromancer</i> who coined the word <i>cyberspace,</i> once said, &#x201c;The future is already here. It&#x2019;s just unevenly distributed.&#x201d;<br><br> Predicting the world of 2100 is a daunting task, since we are in an era of profound scientific upheaval, in which the pace of discovery is always accelerating. More scientific knowledge has been accumulated just in the last few decades than in all human history. And by 2100, this scientific knowledge will again have doubled many times over.<br><br> But perhaps the best way to grasp the enormity of predicting 100 years into the future is to recall the world of 1900 and remember the lives our grandparents lived.<br><br> Journalist Mark Sullivan asks us to imagine someone reading a newspaper in the year 1900:<br><br> In his newspapers of January 1, 1900, the American found no such word as radio, for that was yet twenty years in from coming; nor &#x201c;movie,&#x201d; for that too was still mainly of the future; nor chauffeur, for the automobile was only just emerging and had been called &#x201c;horseless carriage. . . .&#x201d; There was no such word as aviator. . . . Farmers had not heard of tractors, nor bankers of the Federal Reserve System. Merchants had not heard of chain--stores nor &#x201c;self--service&#x201d;; nor seamen of oil--burning engines. . . . Ox--teams could still be seen on country roads. . . . Horses or mules for trucks were practically universal. . . . The blacksmith beneath the spreading chestnut--tree was a reality.<br><br> To understand the difficulty of predicting the next 100 years, we have to appreciate the difficulty that the people of 1900 had in predicting the world of 2000. In 1893, as part of the World&#x2019;s Columbian Exposition in Chicago, seventy--four well--known individuals were asked to predict what life would be like in the next 100 years. The one problem was that they consistently underestimated the rate of progress of science. For example, many correctly predicted that we would one day have commercial transatlantic airships, but they thought that they would be balloons. Senator John J. Ingalls said, &#x201c;It will be as common for the citizen to call for his dirigible balloon as it now is for his buggy or his boots.&#x201d; They also consistently missed the coming of the automobile. Postmaster General John Wanamaker stated that the U.S. mail would be delivered by stagecoach and horseback, even 100 years into the future.<br><br> This underestimation of science and innovation even extended to the patent office. In 1899, Charles H. Duell, commissioner of the U.S. Office of Patents, said, &#x201c;Everything that can be invented has been invented.&#x201d;<br><br> Sometimes experts in their own field underestimated what was happening right beneath their noses. In 1927, Harry M. Warner, one of the founders of Warner Brothers, remarked during the era of silent movies, &#x201c;Who the hell wants to hear actors talk?&#x201d;<br><br> And Thomas Watson, chairman of IBM, said in 1943, &#x201c;I think there is a world market for maybe five computers.&#x201d;<br><br> This underestimation of the power of scientific discovery even extended to the venerable <i>New York Times.</i> (In 1903, the <i>Times</i> declared that flying machines were a waste of time, just a week before the Wright brothers successfully flew their airplane at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. In 1920, the <i>Times</i> criticized rocket scientist Robert Goddard, declaring his work nonsense because rockets cannot move in a vacuum. Forty--nine years later, when <i>Apollo 11</i> astronauts landed on the moon, the <i>Times,</i> to its credit, ran the retraction: ...</p><h2>Future Grace, Revised Edition: The Purifying Power of the Promises of God</h2><p><p><b>Explore this stunning quality of God&#x2019;s grace:&nbsp; <i>It never ends!</i></b><br><br>In this revision of a foundational work, John Piper reveals how grace is not only God&#x2019;s undeserved gift to us in the past, but also God&#x2019;s power to make good happen for us today, tomorrow, and forever.&nbsp;<br><br>True life for the follower of Jesus really is a moment-by-moment trust that God is dependable and fulfills his promises.&nbsp; This is living by faith in <i>future grace</i>, which provides God's mercy, provision, and wisdom&#x2014;everything we need&#x2014;to accomplish his good plans for us.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>In <i>Future Grace</i>, chapter by chapter&#x2014;one for each day of the month&#x2014;Piper reveals how cherishing the promises of God helps break the power of persistent sin issues like anxiety, despondency, greed, lust, bitterness, impatience, pride, misplaced shame, and more.<br><br>Ultimate joy, peace, and hope in life and death are found in a confident, continual awareness of the reality of future grace.</p></p><p><p><b>JOHN PIPER</b>&nbsp;is pastor for preaching and vision at Bethlehem Baptist Church, Minneapolis, Minnesota. He has written over forty books, including&nbsp;<i>Desiring God, God Is the Gospel,</i>&nbsp;<i>Don&#x2019;t Waste Your Life,&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>The Pleasures of God.</i>&nbsp;John and his wife, Noel, have five children and twelve grandchildren.</p><b>What Is Gratitude? <br></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like most precious things, gratitude is vulnerable. We easily forget that gratitude exists because sometimes things come to us <i>&#x201c;gratis&#x201d;&#x2014;</i>without price or payment. When that happens, we should feel a pleasant sense of the worth of what we&#x2019;ve received and the goodwill behind it. This pleasant sense is what we call gratitude. Then, spontaneously rising from this pleasant sense, come expressions of delight. We feel constrained with joy to acknowledge the gift and the goodwill behind it, and to express how good we feel about the gift and the heart of the giver.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gratitude corresponds to grace (&#x201c;gratis&#x201d;). This is true even when we feel thankful for something we have paid for. We sense that what we bought might have been disappointing in spite of our having enough money to buy it. It might not have been in such good condition; or it might not have been the exact one we wanted; or someone might have bought it before we did; or the transaction might have been harsh; or the timing might have been wrong for our intended use; or the price might have gone up just after we bought it. In other words, gratitude is not the feeling that we have been shrewd in the way we get things. It is the emotion that rises joyfully in response to something &#x201c;gratis,&#x201d; even in our purchases.<br><br><b>The Birthplace of the Debtor&#x2019;s Ethic<br></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But right at this point there lurks a danger. There is an impulse in the fallen human heart&#x2014;all our hearts&#x2014;to forget that gratitude is a spontaneous response of joy to receiving something over and above what we paid for. When we forget this, what happens is that gratitude starts to be misused and distorted as an impulse to pay for the very thing that came to us &#x201c;gratis.&#x201d; This terrible moment is the birthplace of the &#x201c;debtor&#x2019;s ethic.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The debtor&#x2019;s ethic says, &#x201c;Because you have done something good for me, I feel indebted to do something good for you.&#x201d; This impulse is not what gratitude was designed to produce. God meant gratitude to be a spontaneous<br>expression of pleasure in the gift and the good will of another. He did not mean it to be an impulse to return favors. If gratitude is twisted into a sense of debt, it gives birth to the debtor&#x2019;s ethic&#x2014;and the effect is to nullify grace.<br>Don&#x2019;t misunderstand me. Gratitude itself does not nullify grace. It exults in grace. It was created by God to echo grace. Even the thought that it can be twisted to serve evil shocks some people and makes them shrink back. Make no mistake, I exalt gratitude as a central biblical response of the heart to the grace of God. The Bible commands gratitude to God as one of our highest duties. &#x201c;Enter his gates with thanksgiving, and his courts with praise! Give thanks to him; bless his name!&#x201d; (Psalm 100:4). God says that gratitude glorifies him: &#x201c;The one who offers thanksgiving as his sacrifice glorifies me&#x201d; (Psalm 50:23). In spite of being vulnerable to misuse in the<br>debtor&#x2019;s ethic, gratitude is not guilty.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We all know what the debtor&#x2019;s ethic is, even if we&#x2019;ve never called it this. Suppose you invite me over for dinner. It is certainly right for me to feel gratitude. But O, how easily we distort this spontaneous response of joy into an impulse to pay back. You gave me an invitation and now I owe you one. When our virtue&#x2014;toward other people, or toward God&#x2014;is born out of this sense of &#x201c;paying back,&#x201d; we are in the grip of the debtor&#x2019;s ethic. What&#x2019;s gone wrong? It&#x2019;s not wrong to feel gratitude when someone gives us a gift. The trouble starts with the impulse that now we owe a &#x201c;gift.&#x201d; What this feeling does is turn gifts into legal currency. Subtly the gift is no longer a gift but a business transaction. And what was offered as free grace is nullified by distorted gratitude.<br><br><b>Should We Pay God Back?<br></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is remarkable how widespread and durable the debtor&#x2019;s ethic is among Christians. Recently I heard a well-known evangelical leader deliver a powerful message about the need for Americans to recover the call of duty and devotion to Christ. He used a compelling illustration about self-sacrifice. But his explanation of the spiritual dynamics of the sacrifice focused entirely on gratitude for what Christ had done. I sat there longing to hear a strong word about the essential role of hope as the sustaining power of laying your life down. But it didn&#x2019;t come.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This way of motivating duty and devotion seems harmless, even noble. Its appeal is strong. It speaks in words that are almost above criticism. For example, it might say, &#x201c;God has done so much for you; now what will you do for him?&#x201d; Or: &#x201c;He gave you his very life; now how much will you give to him?&#x201d; The refrain of Frances Havergal&#x2019;s old hymn &#x201c;I Gave My Life for Thee&#x201d; is hazardous language. In it Christ says, &#x201c;I gave, I gave My life for thee, what hast thou given for Me?&#x201d; And: &#x201c;I bring, I bring rich gifts to thee, what hast thou brought to Me?&#x201d; I don&#x2019;t mean that sentences like these must express the debtor&#x2019;s ethic. I only mean that they easily can, and often do.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the debtor&#x2019;s ethic, the Christian life is pictured as an effort to pay back the debt we owe to God. Usually the concession is made that we can never fully pay it off. But &#x201c;gratitude&#x201d; demands that we work at it. Good deeds and religious acts are the installment payments we make on the unending debt we owe God. This debtor&#x2019;s ethic often lies, perhaps unintentionally, beneath the words, &#x201c;We should obey Christ out of gratitude.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This appeal to gratitude as a way of motivating Christians is so common it may come as a shock when I question whether it has much biblical support. But consider this for a moment. How many places in the Bible can you think of where gratitude or thankfulness is explicitly made the motive of moral behavior? I mean behaviors like treating people with love, and doing your business with integrity, and taking risks in the obedience of missions. Does the Bible tell us that these things are to be done &#x201c;out of gratitude,&#x201d; or &#x201c;in the power of thankfulness,&#x201d; or &#x201c;because we owe Jesus so much&#x201d;?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is not nitpicking or incidental; it is amazing. If you ask Christians today, &#x201c;What is the biblical motive for Christian obedience?&#x201d; great numbers would say, &#x201c;Gratitude to God.&#x201d; And yet this way of thinking seems almost<br>totally lacking in the Bible. The Bible rarely, if ever, explicitly makes gratitude the impulse of moral behavior, or ingratitude the explanation of immorality. This is stunning when you let it sink in. This most common way of talking<br>about motivating Christian obedience is scarcely mentioned in the Bible. This fact comes like a punch in the belly; it takes your breath away. Is this really so? You will need to search for yourself to be completely sure.<br><br><b>Was Ingratitude the Problem?<br></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Old Testament the people of God often sinned against him despite all the good things he had done for them. But the reason given for this sin is not their ingratitude but, for example, their lack of faith: &#x201c;How long will they not believe in me, in spite of all the signs that I have done among them?&#x201d; (Numbers 14:11). The ethical problem troubling Moses is not ingratitude. What troubles him is that God&#x2019;s past grace did not move the people to trust in<br>God&#x2019;s future grace. Faith in future grace, not gratitude, is the missing ethical power to overcome rebellion and motivate obedience.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just when today&#x2019;s Christian would probably say the problem is lack of gratitude, the biblical writers again and again say that the problem is a lack of faith in God&#x2019;s future grace. Moses rebukes the people, &#x201c;You have seen how<br>the Lord your God carried you, as a man carries his son.... Yet in spite of this word you did not believe the Lord your God&#x201d; (Deuteronomy 1:31&#x2013;32). The psalmist gives the same reason for why God&#x2019;s people sinned in spite of all his blessings: although God &#x201c;split rocks in the wilderness and gave them drink abundantly...yet they sinned still more against him...because they did not believe in God and did not trust his saving power&#x201d; (Psalm 78:15, 17, 22).<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It&#x2019;s true that the disobedient people must have lacked gratitude. But that&#x2019;s not how the Bible explains their rebellion and disobedience. Repeatedly the explanation given is lack of faith in God&#x2019;s future grace. The missing<br>channel of motivating power between past grace and today&#x2019;s obedience was not gratitude but faith. You will read the Old Testament in vain for texts that make gratitude the explicit motive or power for obedience.<br><br><b>The Fear of the Lord and Faith in Future Grace<br></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are other Old Testament motives for obedience, such as love to God and fear of the Lord. We will deal in coming chapters with the relationship between faith in future grace and love for God.1 But this is a good place to<br>say a word about the fear of the Lord and its relationship to obedience and to faith in future grace.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moses taught Israel that the fear of the Lord would give rise to obedience: &#x201c;Fear the Lord your God...by keeping all his statutes and his commandments&#x201d; (Deuteronomy 6:2). Solomon summed up his own teaching in Ecclesiastes, &#x201c;The end of the matter; all has been heard. Fear God and keep his commandments&#x201d; (Ecclesiastes 12:13). Nehemiah told the nobles and rulers in Jerusalem to &#x201c;walk in the fear of our God&#x201d; (Nehemiah 5:9). And Proverbs 23:17 says, &#x201c;Continue in the fear of the Lord all the day.&#x201d; Right &#x201c;walking&#x201d; and right living flow from fearing God. But to my knowledge there are no expressions corresponding to these that link gratitude and obedience in the same way.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And even these expressions about fearing the Lord are probably the flip side of trusting the Lord&#x2019;s future grace.2 In other words, &#x201c;fear the Lord&#x201d; means &#x201c;fear the terrible insult it would be to God if you do not trust his gracious promises of power and wisdom on your behalf.&#x201d; That&#x2019;s probably why Psalm 115:11 says, &#x201c;You who fear the Lord, trust in the Lord! He is their help and their shield.&#x201d; In other words, if fear is not mingled with trust, it will not be pleasing to the Lord. &#x201c;Without faith it is impossible to please [God]&#x201d; (Hebrews 11:6). The obedience that comes from fearing God without faith in his future grace will not be free, but servile.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The interconnectedness of fear and faith is probably why people looked at the grace given to David in distress, and felt fear and trust rising side by side in their hearts. &#x201c;He put a new song in my mouth, a song of praise to our God. Many will see and fear, and put their trust in the Lord&#x201d; (Psalm 40:3). The same thing had happened at the Red Sea. &#x201c;Israel saw the great power that the Lord used against the Egyptians, so the people feared the Lord, and they believed in the Lord&#x201d; (Exodus 14:31). Fear and faith happen together in response to God&#x2019;s mighty power and his promise of future grace.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To fear the Lord is to tremble at the awareness of what a terrible insult it is to a holy God if we do not have faith in his future grace after all the signs and wonders he has performed to win our obedient trust. It&#x2019;s this faith in<br>future grace that channels the power of God into obedience. We search the Old Testament in vain for the explicit teaching that gratitude is a channel of this power.</p><h2>The Final Quest Trilogy</h2><p>What if a single revelation could change your destiny in a&nbsp;moment?

At first the autograph seekers came in a trickle, and then they clogged hallways in long lines. At the evening banquet, the symposium&#x2019;s chairman took the microphone to announce that &#x201c;one of the greatest scientific minds of our time&#x201d; was in attendance and would share a few words&#x2014;but once he arrived onstage, the thin, white-haired man could not make himself heard over the peals of applause.<br> <br>And then finally, when the noise had died down: &#x201c;This is&#x2014;ridiculous!&#x201d; Lacking more to say, he removed three balls from his pocket and began to juggle.<br> <br>After it was over, someone asked the chairman to put into perspective what had just happened. &#x201c;It was,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;as if Newton had showed up at a physics conference.<br> <br>It was 1985, and the juggler&#x2019;s work was long over, and just beginning. It had been nearly four decades since Claude Elwood Shannon published &#x201c;the Magna Carta of the Information Age&#x201d;&#x2014;invented, in a single stroke, the idea of information. And yet the world his idea had made possible was only just coming into being. Now we live immersed in that world, and every email we have ever sent, every DVD and sound file we have ever played, and every Web page we have ever loaded bears a debt to Claude Shannon.<br> <br>It was a debt he was never especially keen to collect. He was a man immune to scientific fashion and insulated from opinion of all kinds, on all subjects, even himself, especially himself; a man of closed doors and long silences, who thought his best thoughts in spartan bachelor apartments and empty office buildings. A colleague called Shannon&#x2019;s information theory &#x201c;a bomb.&#x201d; It was stunning in its scope&#x2014;he had conceived of a new science nearly from scratch&#x2014;and stunning in its surprise&#x2014;he had gone years barely speaking a word of it to anyone.<br> <br>Of course, information existed before Shannon, just as objects had inertia before Newton. But before Shannon, there was precious little sense of information as an idea, a measurable quantity, an object fitted out for hard science. Before Shannon, information was a telegram, a photograph, a paragraph, a song. After Shannon, information was entirely abstracted into bits. The sender no longer mattered, the intent no longer mattered, the medium no longer mattered, not even the meaning mattered: a phone conversation, a snatch of Morse telegraphy, a page from a detective story were all brought under a common code. Just as geometers subjected a circle in the sand and the disc of the sun to the same laws, and as physicists subjected the sway of a pendulum and the orbits of the planets to the same laws, Claude Shannon made our world possible by getting at the essence of information.<br> <br>It is a puzzle of his life that someone so skilled at abstracting his way past the tangible world was also so gifted at manipulating it. Shannon was a born tinkerer: a telegraph line rigged from a barbed-wire fence, a makeshift barn elevator, and a private backyard trolley tell the story of his small-town Michigan childhood. And it was as an especially advanced sort of tinkerer that he caught the eye of Vannevar Bush&#x2014;soon to become the most powerful scientist in America and Shannon&#x2019;s most influential mentor&#x2014;who brought him to MIT and charged him with the upkeep of the differential analyzer, an analog computer the size of a room, &#x201c;a fearsome thing of shafts, gears, strings, and wheels rolling on disks&#x201d; that happened to be the most advanced thinking machine of its day.<br> <br>Shannon&#x2019;s study of the electrical switches directing the guts of that mechanical behemoth led him to an insight at the foundation of our digital age: that switches could do far more than control the flow of electricity through circuits&#x2014;that they could be used to evaluate any logical statement we could think of, could even appear to &#x201c;decide.&#x201d; A series of binary choices&#x2014;on/off, true/false, 1/0&#x2014;could, in principle, perform a passable imitation of a brain. That leap, as Walter Isaacson put it, &#x201c;became the basic concept underlying all digital computers.&#x201d; It was Shannon&#x2019;s first great feat of abstraction. He was only twenty-one.<br> <br>A career that launched with &#x201c;possibly the most important, and also the most famous, master&#x2019;s thesis of the century&#x201d; brought him into contact and collaboration with thinkers like Bush, Alan Turing, and John von Neumann: all, like Shannon, founders of our era. It brought him into often-reluctant cooperation with the American defense establishment and into arcane work on cryptography, computer-controlled gunnery, and the encrypted transatlantic phone line that connected Roosevelt and Churchill in the midst of world war. And it brought him to Bell Labs, an industrial R&amp;D operation that considered itself less an arm of the phone company than a home for &#x201c;the operation of genius.&#x201d; &#x201c;People did very well at Bell Labs,&#x201d; said one of Shannon&#x2019;s colleagues, &#x201c;when they did what others thought was impossible.&#x201d; Shannon&#x2019;s choice of the impossible was, he wrote, &#x201c;an analysis of some of the fundamental properties of general systems for the transmission of intelligence, including telephony, radio, television, telegraphy, etc.&#x201d;&#x2014;systems that, from a mathematical perspective, appeared to have nothing essential in common until Shannon proved that they had everything essential in common. It would be his second, and greatest, feat of abstraction.<br> <br>Before the publication of his &#x201c;Mathematical Theory of Communication,&#x201d; scientists could track the movement of electrons in a wire, but the possibility that the very idea they stood for could be measured and manipulated just as objectively would have to wait until it was proved by Shannon. It was summed up in his recognition that all information, no matter the source, the sender, the recipient, or the meaning, could be efficiently represented by a sequence of bits: information&#x2019;s fundamental unit.<br> <br>Before the &#x201c;Mathematical Theory of Communication,&#x201d; a century of common sense and engineering trial and error said that noise&#x2014;the physical world&#x2019;s tax on our messages&#x2014;had to be lived with. And yet Shannon proved that noise could be defeated, that information sent from Point A could be received with perfection at Point B, not just often, but essentially always. He gave engineers the conceptual tools to digitize information and send it flawlessly (or, to be precise, with an arbitrarily small amount of error), a result considered hopelessly utopian up until the moment Shannon proved it was not. Another engineer marveled, &#x201c;How he got that insight, how he even came to believe such a thing, I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d;<br> <br>That insight is embedded in the circuits of our phones, our computers, our satellite TVs, our space probes still tethered to the earth with thin cords of 0&#x2019;s and 1&#x2019;s. In 1990, the Voyager 1 probe turned its camera back on Earth from the edge of the solar system, snapped a picture of our planetary home reduced in size to less than a single pixel&#x2014;to what Carl Sagan called &#x201c;a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam&#x201d;&#x2014;and transmitted that picture across four billion miles of void. Claude Shannon did not write the code that protected that image from error and distortion, but, some four decades earlier, he had proved that such a code must exist. And so it did. It is part of his legacy; and so is the endless flow of digital information on which the Internet depends, and so is the information omnivory by which we define ourselves as modern.<br> <br>By his early thirties, he was one of the brightest stars of American science, with the media attention and prestigious awards to prove it. Yet, at the height of his brief fame, when his information theory had become the buzz-phrase to explain everything from geology to politics to music, Shannon published a four-paragraph article kindly urging the rest of the world to vacate his &#x201c;bandwagon.&#x201d; Impatient with all but the most gifted, he still knew very little of ambition, or ego, or avarice, or any of the other unsightly drivers of accomplishment. His best ideas waited years for publication, and his interest drifted across problems on a private channel of its own. Having completed his pathbreaking work by the age of thirty-two, he might have spent his remaining decades as a scientific celebrity, a public face of innovation: another Bertrand Russell, or Albert Einstein, or Richard Feynman, or Steve Jobs. Instead, he spent them tinkering.<br> <br>An electronic, maze-solving mouse named Theseus. An Erector Set turtle that walked his house. The first plan for a chess-playing computer, a distant ancestor of IBM&#x2019;s Deep Blue. The first-ever wearable computer. A calculator that operated in Roman numerals, code-named THROBAC (&#x201c;Thrifty Roman-Numeral Backward-Looking Computer&#x201d;). A fleet of customized unicycles. Years devoted to the scientific study of juggling.<br> <br>And, of course, the Ultimate Machine: a box and a switch, which, when flipped on, produced a whirring of gears and a mechanical hand that emerged from the box, flipped the switch off, and disappeared again. Claude Shannon was self-effacing in much the same way. Rarely has a thinker who devoted his life to the study of communication been so uncommunicative. Seen in profile, he almost vanished: a gaunt stick of a man, and a man almost entirely written out of a history defined by self-promoters.<br> <br>His was a life spent in the pursuit of curious, serious play; he was that rare scientific genius who was just as content rigging up a juggling robot or a flamethrowing trumpet as he was pioneering digital circuits. He worked with levity and played with gravity; he never acknowledged a distinction between the two. His genius lay above all in the quality of the puzzles he set for himself. And the marks of his playful mind&#x2014;the mind that wondered how a box of electric switches could mimic a brain, and the mind that asked why no one ever decides to say &#x201c;XFOML RXKHRJFFJUJ&#x201d;&#x2014;are imprinted on all of his deepest insights. Maybe it is too much to presume that the character of an age bears some stamp of the character of its founders; but it would be pleasant to think that so much of what is essential to ours was conceived in the spirit of play.</p><h2>The Psychedelic Gospels: The Secret History of Hallucinogens in Christianity</h2><p>Reveals evidence of visionary plants in Christianity and the life of Jesus found in medieval art and biblical scripture--hidden in plain sight for centuries<br><br>� Follows the authors&#x2019; anthropological adventure discovering sacred mushroom images in European and Middle Eastern churches, including Roslyn Chapel and Chartres<br><br>� Provides color photos showing how R.

Gordon Wasson, the famous &#x201c;sacred mushroom seeker,&#x201d; on psychedelics in ancient Greece and India, and among the present-day reindeer herders of Siberia and the Mazatecs of Mexico. Challenging Wasson&#x2019;s legacy, the authors reveal his secret relationship with the Vatican that led to Wasson&#x2019;s refusal to pursue his hallucinogen theory into the hallowed halls of Christianity.<br><br>Examining the Bible and the Gnostic Gospels, the authors provide scriptural support to show that sacred mushrooms were the inspiration for Jesus&#x2019; revelation of the Kingdom of Heaven and that he was initiated into these mystical practices in Egypt during the Missing Years. They contend that the Trees of Knowledge and of Immortality in Eden were sacred mushrooms.<br><br>Uncovering the role played by visionary plants in the origins of Judeo-Christianity, the authors invite us to rethink what we know about the life of Jesus and to consider a controversial theory that challenges us to explore these sacred pathways to the divine.</p><p>Jerry B. Brown, Ph.D., is an educator, anthropologist and activist. From 1972 to 2014 he served as founding professor of anthropology at Florida International University in Miami, where he taught a course on &#x201c;Hallucinogens and Culture.&#x201d; Julie M. Brown, M.A., is a holistic psychotherapist and health coach, who researches the role of sacred plants in religion.<b>8 <br> <br>The Prophet Has Spoken Nohant-Vic, France--1120 <br> <br></b>The Church of St. Martin sat unpretentiously amidst a cluster of modest two-story stone homes with pitched roofs; their terracotta tiles glistened with the light rain. <br> <br>A plaque in the parking lot described the murals as &#x201c;the work of an artist of genius, which portrays the theme of Redemption, from the Error of Adam to the Last Judgment.&#x201d; <br> <br>Stepping across the threshold was like having cataracts removed from your eyes and suddenly seeing in vibrant color and high-definition. Here the rich red, ochre, and white hues of the nativity scenes in the nave were a prelude to the panoply of powerful paintings that filled the choir in the adjoining room. <br> <br>Once inside, Julie and I were enchanted by the majestic visual feast of frescos guarded over by rosy-cheeked seraphim. The church bells began to peal, transporting us back to medieval times. Julie took my arm and turned me around to look at the wall-length panel of <i>Christ&#x2019;s Entry into Jerusalem</i>. &#x201c;Do you see what I see?&#x201d; she asked in amazement. There was no way I could miss the smooth caps of five psilocybin mushrooms. The brown-and-white colored caps gracefully spread out over the heads of the three joyful youth welcoming Jesus into the city for his <br>messianic date with destiny. <br> <br>&#x201c;Look how big these mushrooms are, as big as the heads of the young men,&#x201d; Julie noted. <br> <br>&#x201c;Size matters in Romanesque art,&#x201d; I replied, &#x201c;because the painter is calling our attention to its importance.&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;Now step back and tell me exactly what you see,&#x201d; I said. She spoke slowly, while rapidly clicking photos, as if she were rushing to capture these images before they could disappear, even though they had been here for nearly a thousand years. <br> <br>&#x201c;I see a man kneeling before a much larger robed figure, possibly an angel entering the scene from above, whose body is bathed in concentric circles of light. There is a hand coming out of the light. Between the thumb and index finger is a tan, roundish object that is being offered to the man who is looking up in awe.&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;Anything else?&#x201d; I inquired. <br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, the robes of the angel and of the kneeling man, and the border below them, are painted sky blue. This color also tints the robes of Jesus&#x2019;s disciple.&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;Why do you think that&#x2019;s Jesus?&#x201d; I asked. <br> <br>&#x201c;Because he&#x2019;s riding on an ass, which is how the Bible depicts his entry into Jerusalem at Passover. Walking directly behind Jesus are two men holding their arms up in the gesture of standing in awe. Jesus is sitting on an ass with his arms reaching out toward the youths who are greeting him. One of the youths is leaning forward, holding on to the stem of an oblong mushroom in his left hand, while offering Jesus, with his right hand, three stems whose tops have been painted over or somehow obscured.&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;While the youth holding the mushroom is wearing a cape, the two youths below have taken off their capes, unfolding them to welcome Jesus as if rolling out a royal carpet. The furls in the capes extend all the way below the figure of Jesus and are repeated in the robes of the disciples as well as in the robes of the kneeling man and the angel, visually tying both scenes together.&#x201d; <br> <br>Julie turned to the right and said, &#x201c;Jesus and his disciples are traveling toward the gates of Jerusalem, where a rotund man on top of the tower is using a long knife to cut through the stem of a mushroom. It&#x2019;s the same shape and color as the mushrooms in the last scene. These towers are adjacent to the scene of the <i>Last Supper</i>, where Jesus and eleven of his disciples are gathered behind the table, while the twelfth disciple, probably Judas, is kneeling on the other side.&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;Jesus is extending a very long arm toward Judas&#x2019;s mouth, holding something in his fingers out to Judas, similar to the way the angel is holding something out to Isaiah. I can&#x2019;t tell what it is. But, look, there are four long knives on the table, just like the one used to cut down the mushrooms in the adjoining tower scene!&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t the Last Supper supposed to be a Passover meal?&#x201d; I asked. <br> <br>&#x201c;This is definitely not a Passover Seder, because there is no Pascal lamb or wine goblets, only bowls and round objects,&#x201d; Julie pointed out. &#x201c;In fact, the mushroom caps being cut on top of the tower and the objects on the table share the same round form, size, and coloration. This repetition of mushroom caps and knives connects the scenes visually and also suggests a sequence from the cutting of the mushroom caps to their later appearance on the table. And, look at the way in which the table itself is rotated forward so that it&#x2019;s parallel with the plane of the entire picture. In combining scale--the large size of the mushroom caps--and perspective, the artist is calling attention to the objects on the table.&#x201d; <br> <br>Julie grabbed her camera, zoomed in on the <i>Last Supper</i>, and then passed the camera to me, telling me to look closely at the robes of the disciples seated to the left of Jesus. To my surprise, neatly drawn into the folds of their hems were four umbrella-shaped psilocybin mushrooms caps whose stems were all linked together. <br> <br>&#x201c;Look!&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;There&#x2019;s also a mushroom in the hem of the disciple directly to the right of Jesus as well as two more at the tip of Judas&#x2019; robe. The artist painted the mushrooms into the folds, as if trying to disguise them. These mushroom hems are neatly aligned because the artist is telling us how important they are--a way of informing initiates that entheogens were present at the Last Supper.&#x201d;</p><h2>Prairie Day (Little House Picture Book)</h2><p><p><strong>With the My First Little House picture book series, the youngest readers can share in the joy of Laura Ingalls Wilder&#x2019;s Little House books in these illustrated adaptations of the beloved series!</strong></p><p>Laura and her family are journeying across the flat Kansas prairie to find a new home.&nbsp; There are gophers and rabbits to play with in the daytime, and a cozy camp awaits at night.&nbsp; </p><p>Renee Graef&#x2019;s illustrations are based on Garth Williams&#x2019; classic artwork.</p></p><p>Join Laura and her family on their journey across the flat Kansas prairie.

Ren�e Graef's enchanting full-color illustrations, inspired by Garth Williams' classic artwork, bring Laura and her family lovingly to life in this ninth title in the My First Little House Books series, picture books adapted from Laura Ingalls Wilder's beloved storybooks. <p></p><p>Laura Ingalls Wilder (1867&#x2013;1957) was born in a log cabin in the Wisconsin woods. With her family, she pioneered throughout America&#x2019;s heartland during the 1870s and 1880s, finally settling in Dakota Territory. She married Almanzo Wilder in 1885; their only daughter, Rose, was born the following year. The Wilders moved to Rocky Ridge Farm at Mansfield, Missouri, in 1894, where they established a permanent home.

In Episode III Revenge of the Sith the fates of key players on both sides of the conflict will be sealed. But first, crucial events that pave the way to that time of reckoning unfold in a labyrinth of evil. . . .<br><br>Capturing Trade Federation Viceroy&#x2013;and Separatist Councilmember&#x2013;Nute Gunray is the mission that brings Jedi Knights Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker, with a squad of clones in tow, to Neimoidia. But the treacherous ally of the Sith proves as slippery as ever, evading his Jedi pursuers even as they narrowly avoid deadly disaster. Still, their daring efforts yield an unexpected prize: a unique holotransceiver that bears intelligence capable of leading the Republic forces to their ultimate quarry, the ever-elusive Darth Sidious. <br><br>Swiftly taking up the chase, Anakin and Obi-Wan follow clues from the droid factories of Charros IV to the far-flung worlds of the Outer Rim . . . every step bringing them closer to pinpointing the location of the Sith Lord&#x2013;whom they suspect has been manipulating every aspect of the Separatist rebellion. Yet somehow, in the escalating galaxy-wide chess game of strikes, counterstrikes, ambushes, sabotage, and retaliations, Sidious stays constantly one move ahead.<br><br>Then the trail takes a shocking turn. For Sidious and his minions have set in motion a ruthlessly orchestrated campaign to divide and overwhelm the Jedi forces&#x2013;and bring the Republic to its knees.</p><p>Author James Luceno returns to the prequel biz with <i>Star Wars: Labyrinth of Evil</i>, a novel sure to be required reading for die-hard fans of George Lucas's galaxy far, far away. Written with Lucas's blessing, Luceno's tale leads right to the opening sequence of <i>Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith</i>, setting the stage for the fiery conclusion of the Clone Wars and the rise of the Empire. <p> As the action begins, the Republic and Jedi have seemingly pushed the Separatists and Sith back into the outer reaches of the galaxy thanks to the clone army deployed in <i>Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones</i>. But as victory seems near, the ruthless General Grievous--think Darth Vader on steroids--emerges from the shadows. In the battle against Grievous, Anakin Skywalker--who is a little Vader-ish too these days--and Obi Wan Kenobi find themselves in a race to discover the identity of the Sith Lord Darth Sidious and unravel the web of duplicity surrounding the Separatist uprising. </p><p> While essential for obsessive fans, <i>Labyrinth of Evil</i> is a clunky novel and Luceno struggles with Lucas's ungainly and Byzantine plotting. Full of cumbersome, <i>Star Wars</i> technophillia, the novel merely serves its purpose by fleshing out the thin line between Episodes II and III. True believers will revel in the level of technical detail and tantalizing nuggets of trivia while the less zealous could satisfy their Star Wars cravings by checking out Timothy Zahn's masterful post-Episode VI works. <i>--Jeremy Pugh</i></p><b>James Luceno </b>is the <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author of the <i>Star Wars</i> novels <i>Millennium Falcon, Dark Lord: The Rise of Darth Vader, Cloak of Deception, Labyrinth of Evil,</i> as well as the New Jedi Order novels <i>Agents of Chaos I: Hero&#x2019;s Trial </i>and<i> Agents of Chaos II: Jedi Eclipse, The Unifying Force, </i>and the eBook <i>Darth Maul: Saboteur</i>.

The telling of the tales is organized by clan, giving a full-page overview of each character's place in the saga. While this book is a handy companion for fans of the series, it is absolutely mind-boggling for anyone who has not read at least one of the novels. The dizzying number of felines and their relationships is difficult to keep track of, and events mentioned make no sense without prior knowledge of the books. The lack of family trees is unfortunate-there are by now several generations of cats, as well as cross-mating among the clans-and there is a breakdown of the naming codes used to distinguish the warriors; titles such as "kit," "paw," and "star" change as the cats move up within the hierarchy of the clans. One element that will be evident to new readers is the ferocity of these animals' lives, which is in keeping with the tone and spirit of the novels. The full-color portraits of these cats are spectacular. They show these characters to be exciting, vibrant, and unique, and will interest new readers much more than the tone-heavy, mysterious musings of the narrator.&#x2014;<i>Kara Schaff Dean, Walpole Public Library, MA</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

As distant in time from the Five Books of Moses as Updike is from Shakespeare, these Late Biblical books are innovative, entertaining literary works. Women often stand center stage. The Song of Songs is a celebration of young love, frankly sensuous, with no reference to God or covenant. It offers some of the most beautiful love poems of the ancient world. The story of Queen Esther&#x2019;s shrewd triumph is also a secular entertainment, with clear traces of farce and sly sexual comedy. The character of Ruth embodies the virtues of loyalty, love, and charity in a harmonious world. Enigma replaces harmony in Daniel&#x2019;s feverish night dreams. The apocalyptic strangeness of Daniel echoes in works from the New Testament&#x2019;s Book of Revelations to the lyrics of Bob Dylan.

He tells a story of development in four parts&#x2015;colonialism, developmentalism, globalization, and sustainability&#x2015;that shows how the global development "project" has&nbsp; taken different forms from one historical period to the next. Throughout the text, the underlying conceptual framework is that development is a political construct, created by dominant actors (states, multilateral institutions, corporations and economic coalitions) and based on unequal power arrangements. While rooted in ideas about progress and prosperity, development also produces crises that threaten the health and well-being of millions of people, and sparks organized resistance to its goals and policies. Frequent case studies make the intricacies of globalization concrete, meaningful, and clear. <strong>Development and Social Change: A Global Perspective</strong> challenges us to see ourselves as global citizens even as we are global consumers.</p><p><b>Philip McMichael</b> grew up in Adelaide, South Australia, and is an International Professor of Development Sociology at Cornell University. His book Settlers and The Agrarian Question: Foundations of Capitalism in Colonial Australia (Cambridge University Press, �1984) won the 1995 Social Science History Association&#x2032;s Allan Sharlin Memorial Award. He has also edited The Global Restructuring of Agro-Food Systems (Cornell University Press, �1994), Food and Agrarian Orders in the World Economy (Praeger, �1995), New Directions in the Sociology of Global Development (Emerald, �2005), and Contesting Development: Critical Struggles for Social Change (Routledge, �2010). He has served as Director of Cornell University&#x2032;s International Political Economy Program, as Chair of the American Sociological Association&#x2032;s Political Economy of the World-System Section, and President of the Research Committee on the Sociology of Agriculture and Food for the International Sociological Association. And he has recently worked with the FAO, IATP and UNRISD, the International Planning Committee for Food Sovereignty, and the international peasant coalition, La V�a Campesina."The book does a fantastic job of laying out the history of development, and does so by dividing up different development eras into projects. It is packed with excellent and important information. The "case studies" in the book bring occasionally dry issues to life. And I value the book&#x2032;s overarching attention to inequality at all levels as a way to understand the world." Author: Leif Jensen<br><br>"I wanted one book that contained everything that I want my students to know. This book contains it all. The historical continuity woven across chapters allows me to teach development exactly like I want to...I like the emphasis on the environment and climate change, and land grabs / land-based investment." Author: Cynthia Caron<br><br>"The book is very well structured. Difficult concepts are well explained. McMichael makes it very clear what the stages of development are, and brings examples that help students recognize those stages in their own social environment. &nbsp;While reading, students easily find connections between the theory and their observations."

In 1936, the Hungarian poet Charles Sirat� authored the Dimensionist Manifesto, signaling a new movement that called on artists to transcend &#x201c;all the old borders and barriers of the arts.&#x201d; The manifesto was the first attempt to systematize the mass of changes that we now call modern art, and was endorsed by an impressive array of artists, including Jean Arp, Alexander Calder, Robert Delaunay, Sonia Delaunay, C�sar Domela, Marcel Duchamp, Wassily Kandinsky, Joan Mir�, L�szl� Moholy-Nagy, Ben Nicholson, Enrico Prampolini, and Sophie Taeuber-Arp. Dimensionism is the first book in English to explore how these and other &#x201c;Dimensionists&#x201d; responded to the scientific breakthroughs of their era. </p><p>The book, which accompanies a traveling exhibition, reproduces works by the manifesto's initial endorsers and by such artists as Georges Braque, Joseph Cornell, Helen Lundeberg, Man Ray, Herbert Matter, Isamu Noguchi, Pablo Picasso, Kay Sage, Patrick Sullivan, and Dorothea Tanning. It also offers essays by prominent art historians that examine Sirat�'s now almost-forgotten text and the artists who searched for a means of expression that obliterated old conceptions and parameters. Appearing for the first time in English is Sirat�'s own &#x201c;History of the Dimensionist Manifesto,&#x201d; written in 1966. The book brings aa long-forgotten voice and text back into circulation.</p><p><b>Artists</b><br>Alexander Archipenko, Jean Arp, Herbert Bayer, Georges Braque, Alexander Calder, Joseph Cornell, John Covert, Robert Delaunay, Sonia Delaunay, C�sar Domela, Marcel Duchamp, Harold Edgerton, Max Ernst, Naum Gabo, Barbara Hepworth, Wassily Kandinsky, Gerome Kamrowski, Frederick Kann, Helen Lundeberg, Man Ray, Andr� Masson, Roberto Matta, Herbert Matter, Joan Mir�, L�szl� Moholy-Nagy, Henry Moore, Nina Negri, Ben Nicholson, Isamu Noguchi, Gordon Onslow Ford, Wolfgang Paalen, Antoine Pevsner, Pablo Picasso, Enrico Prampolini, Anton Prinner, Kay Sage, Charles Sirat�, Will Henry Stevens, Patrick Sullivan, Sophie Taeuber-Arp, Yves Tanguy, Dorothea Tanning</p><p>Copublished with the Mead Art Museum, Amherst College</p></p><p>Vanja V.

Malloy's illuminating assembly of works related to the Dimensionist Manifesto (1936) brings long-neglected texts by the Hungarian poet and art theorist Charles Tamko Sirat� to art historical attention. Sirat�'s writings inspired many of the historical European avant-garde of poetry, painting, and sculpture, artists who were equally committed to the fusion of the arts with physics, biology, mathematics, and engineering. With an elegant and thoughtful introduction and fine essay by Malloy, and equally impressive scholarly essays by Linda Dalrymple Henderson, Oliver A. I. Botar, and Gavin Parkinson, this exciting volume makes a unique contribution to understanding how the modernist avant-garde united visual and textual discourses ranging from cubism and quantum mechanics to the fourth dimension. In this outstanding study, Malloy has brought readers an exciting, accessible account of long-forgotten aspects of the avant-garde that anticipated the unity of art and science today.</p>&#x2015;<b>Kristine Stiles</b>, France Family Professor of Art, Art History, and Visual Studies, Duke University<br><br><p><i>Dimensionism</i>&nbsp;explores how a profusion of groundbreaking scientific discoveries impacted the course of 20th-century art and art history.

They divide their book into three tiers: factors affecting mental function, tools for developing a better brain and specific brain disorders. Perlmutter, who runs a Florida health center, is quite concerned with showing how brain aging can be prevented and clarity can be regained by making dietary adjustments. He and Colman also warn of the dangers of using prescription or OTC drugs that may be "interfering with your brain's ability to function at optimal levels." From stomach acid suppressors to antidepressants, medications lower brain antioxidants, they say, leaving dangerous free radicals room to roam. Perlmutter and Colman recommend the usual supplemental solutions, but also pay attention to new memory rejuvenating therapies like hormone replacement. There's also an illuminating chapter on the brain toxins present in the average daily diet (e.g., aluminum and mercury), with advice on how to eliminate them. Although the authors sometimes favor an alarmist tone, their book is an informative explanation of how the brain ages and how it can be protected, and it presents novel, practical ideas. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Included are newspaper accounts of a San Francisco murder; a description of Norris' Polk Street neighborhood, which figures prominently in <em>McTeague</em>; an examination of the relationship between the novel and naturalism; and a discussion of the book's genesis, from its origin as a Harvard assignment to Norris's revision of it upon his return to San Francisco. Criticism has been revised to include major recent assessments of the novel. Two seminal pieces from the previous edition have been retained&#x2015;Ernest Marchand's account of <em>McTeague</em>'s 1899 reviews and Donald Pizer's essay on naturalism. Six essays and four stills from Erich von Stroheim's film version of <em>McTeague</em> are new. The new essays are by Don Graham, William E. Cain, Barbara Hochman, James L. Caron, Mary Lawlor, and Donna M. Campbell. A Chronology and an updated Selected Bibliography are included. Illustrated</p><p>The novelist Frank Norris is almost forgotten today, but in books like &#34;McTeague,&#34; published in 1899, he paved the way for a whole generation of American writers--a generation that included Theodore Dreiser and Sinclair Lewis and, less directly, Hemingway and Fitzgerald. McTeague is a dentist saddled with a grasping wife, and the book chronicles his rise and fall in awkward but powerful prose. This type of social realism, so contrary to the uplifting entertainment of the day (and to Mark Twain&#39;s more fanciful, comic novels), provided turn-of-the-century America a disturbing mirror in which to view itself.An unflinchingly realistic portrayal of the moral descent of a San Francisco dentist, <b>McTeague</b>, first published in 1899, helped to propel American literature into the twentieth century. "The novel glows in a light that makes it the first great tragic portrait in America of an acquisitive society," writes Alfred Kazin in the Introduction to this Modern Library Paperback Classic. "McTeague's San Francisco is the underworld of that society, and the darkness of its tragedy, its pitilessness, its grotesque humor, is like the rumbling of hell. Nothing is more remarkable in the book than the detachment with which Norris saw it&#x2014;a tragedy almost literally classic in the Greek sense of the debasement of a powerful man&#x2014;and nothing gives it so much power."</p><h2>Where Angels Fear to Tread (Vintage Classics)</h2><p>"Let her go to Italy!" he cried. "Let her meddle with what she doesn't understand! Look at this letter! The man who wrote it will marry her, or murder her, or do for her somehow. He's a bounder, but he's not an English bounder. He's mysterious and terrible. He's got a country behind him that's upset people from the beginning of the world."<br><br>When a young English widow takes off on the grand tour and along the way marries a penniless Italian, her in-laws are not amused. That the marriage should fail and poor Lilia die tragically are only to be expected. But that Lilia should have had a baby -- and that the baby should be raised as an Italian! -- are matters requiring immediate correction by Philip Herriton, his dour sister Harriet, and their well-meaning friend Miss Abbott.<br><br>In his first novel, E. M. Forster anticipated the themes of cultural collision and the sterility of the English middle class that he would develop in A Room with a View and A Passage to India. Where Angels Fear to Tread is an accomplished, harrowing, and malevolently funny book, in which familiar notions of vice and virtue collapse underfoot and the best intentions go mortally awry.</p><p>6 1-hour cassettes<b>Edward Morgan Forster</b> was born on January 1, 1879, in London and was raised from infancy by his mother and paternal aunts after his father's death. Forster&#x2019;s boyhood experiences at the Tonbridge School, Kent, were an unpleasant contrast to the happiness he found at home, and his suffering left him with an abiding dislike of the English public school system. At King&#x2019;s College, Cambridge, however, he was able to pursue freely his varied interests in philosophy, literature, and Mediterranean civilization, and he soon determined to devote his life to writing.His first two novels,<i>&nbsp;Where Angels Fear to Tread</i>&nbsp;(1905) and&nbsp;<i>The Longest Journey</i>&nbsp;(1907), were both poorly received, and it was not until the publication of&nbsp;<i>Howards End</i>, in 1910, that Forster achieved his first major success as a novelist, with the work many considered his finest creation.Forster first visited India during 1912 and 1913, and after three years as a noncombatant in Alexandria, Egypt, during World War I and several years in England, he returned for an extended visit in 1921. From those experiences came his most celebrated novel,&nbsp;<i>A Passage to India</i>, his darkest and most probing work and perhaps the best novel about India written by a foreigner.As a man of letters, Forster was honored during and after World War II for his resistance to any and all forms of tyranny and totalitarianism, and King&#x2019;s College awarded him a permanent fellowship in 1949. He spent his later years at Cambridge writing and teaching, and died in Coventry, England, on June 7, 1970. His novel,&nbsp;<i>Maurice</i>, written several decades earlier, was published posthumously in 1971.</p><h2>305 Authentic Art Nouveau Jewelry Designs (Dover Jewelry and Metalwork)</h2><p><p>The Art Nouveau movement that flourished at the turn of the 20th century had profound influence on the decorative arts, including jewelry. The style's sweeping, rhythmic curves and use of stylized floral and animal forms lent themselves well to adaptations in precious stones and rare metals. Lalique, Mucha, and Tiffany were perhaps the most famous designers of Art Nouveau jewelry, but there were many lesser-known artists of superior abilities, among them Maurice Dufr�ne (born 1876), who created the present work. Dufr�ne later adopted a simpler style, becoming a leading decorative artist of considerable influence. He was frequently represented in the Salon d'Automne and played a major role in planning the Pris Exposition Universelle of 1937. The work features over 300 spectacular Dufr�ne pieces: pendants, combs, buckles, rings, bracelets, brooches, umbrella handles, penknives, buttons, clasps, and scissors in detailed photographs reprinted from rare, turn-of-the-century folios. The elegant, royalty-free illustrations are exquisitely detailed with flower, foliage, and butterfly motifs, and are readily adaptable to any design use.</p><p></p><p></p></p><p>Text: English, French (translation)</p><h2>The Spy&#39;s Son: The True Story of the Highest-Ranking CIA Officer Ever Convicted of Espionage and the Son He Trained to Spy for Russia</h2><p><b>"A haunting book as fast paced and as exciting as the best spy novel . . . and it&#x2019;s all true."

Out upon merry Christmas! What good had it ever done to him?'</strong><br><br>Ebenezer Scrooge is a bad-tempered skinflint who hates Christmas and all it stands for, but a ghostly visitor foretells three apparitions who will thaw Scrooge's frozen heart. <em>A Christmas Carol </em>has gripped the public imagination since it was first published in 1843, and it is now as much a part of Christmas as mistletoe or plum pudding. This edition reprints the story alongside Dickens's four other Christmas Books: <em>The Chimes, The Cricket on the Hearth, The Battle of Life, </em>and <em>The Haunted Man. </em>All five stories show Dickens at his unpredictable best, jumbling together comedy and melodrama, genial romance and urgent social satire, in pursuit of his aim 'to awaken some loving and forbearing thoughts, never out of season in a Christian land'.<br><br><strong>About the Series:</strong> For over 100 years <strong>Oxford World's Classics</strong> has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe.

What makes this charming edition of Dickens's immortal tale so special is the collection of 80 vivid illustrations by Everett Shinn (1876-1953). Shinn, a well-known artist in his time, was a popular illustrator of newspapers and magazines whose work displayed a remarkable affinity for the stories of Charles Dickens, evoking the bustling street life of the mid-1800s. Printed on heavy, cream-colored paper stock, the edges of the pages have been left rough, simulating the way in which the story might have appeared in Dickens's own time. Though countless editions of this classic have been published over the years, this one stands out as particularly beautiful, nostalgic, and evocative of the spirit of Christmas.<p>Traditional cover with this full-color gift edition in a slipcase.</p></p><h2>The Mark of the Christian</h2><p>In this brief challenge, late philosopher-theologican Frances A.

Administered off-label in small daily doses (0.5 to 4.5 mg), this generic drug is extremely affordable and presents few known side effects. So why has it languished in relative medical obscurity?<br> <br> <em>The LDN Book</em> explains the drug&#x2019;s origins, its primary mechanism, and the latest research from practicing physicians and pharmacists as compiled by Linda Elsegood of The LDN Research Trust, the world&#x2019;s largest LDN charity organization with over 19,000 members worldwide. Featuring ten chapters contributed by medical professionals on LDN&#x2019;s efficacy and two patient-friendly appendices, <em>The LDN Book</em> is a comprehensive resource for doctors, pharmacists, and patients who want to learn more about how LDN is helping people now, and a clarion call for further research that could help millions more.</p></p><p><p>Linda Elsegood is the founder of the LDN Research Trust, which was set up in the UK as a Registered Charity in 2004, and is the editor of <em>The LDN Book</em>. Diagnosed with MS in August of 2000, she started LDN therapy in December of 2003, and now has a better quality of life and hope for the future. Through the Trust, she has connected thousands of patients, doctors, and pharmacists around the world with information, articles, and patient stories about LDN.</p><p>&#x201c;I first came across LDN several years ago when a medical colleague said I should look into its positive effects in patients with MS, Crohn&#x2019;s disease, and other autoimmune disorders. I was so impressed with what I read that I helped submit a petition to the UK government to ask for funding for further research into this inexpensive drug. But, as with so many petitions, no progress was made. I hope&nbsp;<em>The LDN Book</em>&#x2015;which presents up-to-date findings that again confirm the efficacy of this safe, cheap, generic drug in helping to control many chronic, disabling conditions&#x2015;is read by those in the Department of Health and by all doctors caring for patients with autoimmune disease. In the UK, LDN has been stranded in limbo; maybe now the time has come for it to be accepted as a recognized therapy that could, at least, be tried on those suffering such long-term diseases of the immune system.&#x201d;<strong>--Dr. Chris Steele, MBE, general practitioner;&nbsp;medical presenter on ITV&#x2019;s&nbsp;<em>This Morning</em></strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;As a practicing physician who has used LDN as a cornerstone therapy for over fifteen years, I can say without equivocation that LDN is the most important and successful medicine I have ever used. I often joke that if not for LDN I couldn&#x2019;t pay my mortgage; I&#x2019;ve had so many new patients referred to me by someone whose life has improved dramatically through the use of LDN. And despite my knowledge and experience with LDN, I&#x2019;ve learned a great deal from&nbsp;<em>The LDN Book&#x2015;</em>aspects of its basic science I hadn&#x2019;t known, new uses, and how its uses can inform us about the causes of various diseases.

Drawing on a survey of eighty families in Chicago who were interviewed on the subject of their feelings about common household objects, Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi and Eugene Rochberg-Halton provide a unique perspective on materialism, American culture, and the self. They begin by reviewing what social scientists and philosophers have said about the transactions between people and things. In the model of &#39;personhood&#39; that the authors develop, goal-directed action and the cultivation of meaning through signs assume central importance. They then relate theoretical issues to the results of their survey. An important finding is the distinction between objects valued for action and those valued for contemplation. The authors compare families who have warm emotional attachments to their homes with those in which a common set of positive meanings is lacking, and interpret the different patterns of involvement. They then trace the cultivation of meaning in case studies of four families. Finally, the authors address what they describe as the current crisis of environmental and material exploitation, and suggest that human capacities for the creation and redirection of meaning offer the only hope for survival. A wide range of scholars - urban and family sociologists, clinical, developmental and environmental psychologists, cultural anthropologists and philosophers, and many general readers - will find this book stimulating and compelling.</p><p>This is a study of the significance of material possessions in contemporary urban life, and of the ways people carve meaning out of their domestic environment.Eugene Halton is Professor of Sociology and American Studies at the University of Notre Dame. In addition to being coauthor of The Meaning of Things, he is author of Bereft of Reason (1995, 1997), Meaning and Modernity (1986), and a forthcoming book on American culture.</p><h2>Caring: A Feminine Approach to Ethics and Moral Education</h2><p>Ethics has been discussed largely in the language of the father, Nel Noddings believes: in principles and propostions, in terms such as <i>justification,</i> <i>fairness,</i> and <i>equity.</i> The mother's voice has been silent.<br><br>The view of ethics Noddings offers in this book is a feminine view. "This does not imply," she writes, "that all women will accept it or that most men will reject it; indeed there is no reason why men should not embrace it. It is feminine in the deep classical sense&#x2014;rooted in receptivity, relatedness, and responsiveness. It does not imply either that logic is to be discarded or that logic is alien to women. It represents an aternative to present views, one that begins with the moral attitude or longing for goodness and not with moral reasoning."<br><br>What is at the basis of moral action? An altruism acquired by the application of rule and principle? Or, as Noddings asserts, caring and the memory of being cared for? With numerous examples to supplement her rich theoretical discussion, Noddings builds a compelling philosophical argument for an ethics based on natural caring, as in the care of a mother for her child. The ethical behavior that grows out of natural caring has at its core as care-filled receptivity to those involved in any moral situation, and leaves behind the rigidity of rule and principle to focus on what is particular and unique in human relations. "The hand that steadied us as we learned to ride our first bicycle did not provide propositional knowledge, but it guided and supported us all the same, and we finished up 'knowing how.'"<br><br>Noddings's discussion is far-ranging, as she considers whether organizations, which operate at a remove from the caring relationship, can truly be called ethical. She discusses the extent to which we may truly care for plants, animals, or ideas. Finally, she proposes a realignment of education to encourage and reward not just rationality and trained intelligence, but also enhanced sensitivity in moral matters.</p><p><b>Nel Noddings</b> is Lee Jacks Professor of Education, Emerita, Stanford University. She is the author of <i>Educating Moral People: A Caring Alternative to Character Education </i>(2002), <i>Starting at Home: Caring and Social Policy</i> (2002), <i>Women and Evil</i> (California, 1989), <i>The Challenge to Care in Schools</i> (1992), <i>Educating for Intelligent Belief or Unbelief</i> (1993), and <i>Philosophy of Education</i> (1995)."Instead of exploring how moral reasoning develops, or attempting to teach moral choice through rational argument, Noddings examines what it means to care and be cared for, how caring for another person relates to the larger moral picture, and how caring ultimately functions in an educational context. . . . Neither a how-to book nor a syrupy celebration of universal love, <i>Caring </i>is both for general readers and specialists."--<i>New York Times </i> -- <i>Review</i></p><h2>Ways of the World: A Brief Global History with Sources, Volume I</h2><p>Focusing on significant historical trends, themes, and developments in world history, <em>Ways of the World: A Brief Global History with Sources, Volume I</em> shows you the big picture of history as you learn to consider evidence the way historians do.</p><p></p><h2>Justine, or the Misfortunes of Virtue (Oxford World&#39;s Classics)</h2><p>This is the first new translation in over forty years of Sade's novel <em>Justine</em>. It is also the first ever critical edition, based on the original 1791 version of the story, which is the most accessible and artistically successful of the three versions. The novel tells the story of the beautiful and devout Justine, whose steadfast faith and naive trust destine her from the outset for sexual exploitation and martyrdom. The unending catalog of disasters that befall her, during which she is subject to any number of perverse practices, illustrate Sade's belief in the primacy of Nature over civilization. Virtue is no match for vice, and as criminality and violence triumph, Justine is doomed to suffer. Indeed, the novel mounts a ferocious physical and intellectual assault on absolute notions of good and evil. <br><br>John Phillips's lively translation conveys the tone of Sade's original text and his introduction situates Sade's narrative in its historical, literary, and philosophical background, discussing such major themes as attitudes to women, the church, the justice system, and the world of finance, the sadistic and masochistic elements, and the novel's reception. The extensive notes shed light on religious and philosophical ideas and explain allusions to topical events.<br><br><strong>About the Series</strong>: For over 100 years <strong>Oxford World's Classics </strong>has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe.

Like Charles Manson, he exercised a cult-like mind control over others who did his dirty work. But unlike Manson, both Sexton's victims and his subjects were his very own flesh and blood." As strong as they are, these words from an assistant district attorney barely hint at the depravity hidden for years within the Sexton family. Strange notions about "Futuretrons" and hand markings that convey absolute power, revelations of incest and physical abuse, bodies buried in the camping area of a Florida state park--<i> House of Secrets</i> has so many layers of weirdness that it will amaze even seasoned readers of true crime. Lowell Cauffiel has a talent for combining quotations from interviews and unembellished facts into prose that reads like a novel. Two people are dead, and the children who suffered the cruel fate of being born into the Sexton family may never completely heal from their injuries--but at least their story has been told.<b>Lowell Cauffiel&nbsp;</b>is an American true crime author, novelist, and TV producer.

This collection of his four major works, together with a selection of his finest letters and poems, shows that he is not only one of the very greatest European writers: he is also accessible, entertaining, and contemporary.</p><p>The <i>Sorrows of Young Werther</i> is a story of self-destructive love that made its author a celebrity overnight at the age of twenty-five. Its exploration of the conflicts between ideas and feelings, between circumstance and desire, continues in his controversial novel probing the institution of marriage, <i>Elective Affinities</i>. The cosmic drama of <i>Faust</i> goes far beyond the realism of the novels in a poetic exploration of good and evil, while <i>Italian Journey</i>, written in the author&#x2019;s old age, recalls his youth in Italy and the impact of Mediterranean culture on a young northerner.</p><p>Translators include W. H. Auden, Louise Bogan, David Constantine, Barker Fairley, and Elizabeth Mayer</p></p><p>Before he was thirty, Goethe had proven himself a master of the novel, the drama, and lyric poetry. But even more impressive than his versatility was his unwillingness ever to settle into a single style or approach; whenever he used a literary form, he made of it something new.<br><br>Born in 1749 to a well-to-do family in Frankfurt, he was sent to Strasbourg to earn a law degree. There, he met the poet-philosopher Herder, discovered Shakespeare, and began to write poetry. His play <i>G�tz von Berlichingen</i> (1773) made him famous throughout Germany. He was invited to the court of the duke of Sachsen-Weimar, where he quickly became a cabinet minister. In 1774 his novel of Romantic melancholy, <i>The Sorrows of a Young Werther</i>, electrified all of Europe. Soon as he was at work on the first version of his <b>Faust</b>, which would finally appear as a fragment in 1790.<br><br>In the 1780s Goethe visited England and immersed himself in classical poetry. The next decade saw the appearance of <i>Wihelm Meister's Apprenticeship</i>, his novel of a young artist education, and a wealth of poetry and criticism. He returned to the Faust material around the turn of the century and completed Part 1 in 1808.<br><br>The later years of his life were devoted to a bewildering array of pursuits: research in botany and in a theory of colors, a novel (<i>Elective Affinities</i>), the evocative poems of the <i>West-Easters Divan</i>, and his great autobiography, <i>Poetry and Truth</i>. In his eighties he prepared a forty-volume edition of his works; the forty-first volume, published after his death in 1832, was the send part of Faust.<br><br>Goethe's wide-ranging mind could never be confined to one form or one philosophy. When asked for the theme of his masterwork, <b>Faust</b>, he could only say. &#x201c;From heaven through all the world to hell&#x201d;; his subject was nothing smaller.&#x201c;Goethe&#x2019;s greatness is singular: it is difficult to think of any parallel to his achievement . . . At every stage of a long and inwardly turbulent life he rediscovered, or reinvented, himself through his writing, and yet he never significantly repeated himself.

What campus counselors and health providers must do, she argues, is tell uncomfortable, politically incorrect truths, especially to young patients in their most vulnerable and confused moments.

Is that fair? Gain insight into our &#34;reluctant&#34; social welfare system from a top scholar on the subject. Bruce Jansson analyzes the evolution of the American welfare state from colonial times to the present--placing social policy in its political, cultural and societal context. Rather than passively reading, you&#39;ll interact with the issues, oppressed populations, ethical choices, social and ideological conflicts, advocates and policies in preceding eras and in the contemporary period. You&#39;ll see how vulnerable populations and social reformers have achieved progressive reforms through policy advocacy. THE RELUCTANT WELFARE STATE also helps you develop the core competencies and practice behaviors outlined in the Educational Policy and Accreditation Standards (EPAS) set by the Council on Social Work Education (CSWE).</p><p>Bruce S. Jansson (M.A., University of Chicago and Harvard University; Ph.D., University of Chicago) is the Driscoll/Clevenger Professor of Social Policy in the Department of Social Work at the University of Southern California (USC). He joined the USC faculty in 1973 after working in Pennsylvania and Michigan as a community organizer and planner for tenant rights. His scholarly interests focus on advancing mezzo, micro and macro policy advocacy in social work, as well as examining the history and practice of social welfare policy. Dr. Jansson invented the term &#34;policy practice,&#34; which has become a required content area by the Council on Social Work Education. He recently developed the first multi-level policy advocacy framework that discusses policy advocacy at micro, mezzo and macro levels. He also has served as the Moses Distinguished Research Professor at the City University of New York Graduate Center. Dr. Jansson has written two books for Cengage: BECOMING AN EFFECTIVE POLICY ADVOCATE, now in its ninth edition, and THE RELUCTANT WELFARE STATE (9th Edition). Additional books include THE SIXTEEN TRILLION DOLLAR MISTAKE: HOW THE U.S. BUNGLED ITS NATIONAL PRIORITIES FROM THE NEW DEAL TO THE PRESENT (2001), IMPROVING HEALTHCARE THROUGH ADVOCACY and SOCIAL WELFARE SECTORS AND ADVOCACY. He has authored four research articles that develop measurement scales to measure the extent health professionals engage in patient and policy advocacy, as well as predictors of their levels of engagement, and is currently working on a book on inequality.</p><h2>Treating Trauma and Traumatic Grief in Children and Adolescents, First Edition</h2><p>This is the authoritative guide to conducting trauma-focused cognitive-behavioral therapy (TF-CBT), a systematic, evidence-based treatment for traumatized children and their families.

The book is also very accessible given its detailed organization. An added bonus is the inclusion of answers to frequently asked questions, which primarily address commonly confronted difficulties associated with implementing the intervention. Moreover, sample scripts and case examples provided throughout the book help to tailor treatment to specific individual's needs and offer guidance for how to respond to different types of trauma....Highly recommended for clinicians working with child and adolescent clients who suffer from depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress symptoms."

Cohen, Mannarino, and Deblinger, who are accomplished leaders in the field, have successfully compiled their previous research with knowledge gained from community practitioners in an eloquent and practical manner. The book provides a tremendously useful bridge from theoretical construct to hands-on treatment....Particularly refreshing is the recognition and attention given to defining trauma in affective, cognitive, and behavioral domains....In an era of increased accountability and attention to evidence-based practice, this book is on the mark. The authors provide a treatment structure in which the connection between theory and practice is purposeful, apparent, and meaningful. It is a how-to manual for treating trauma and traumatic grief.

In this rare firsthand account, Fortunate Eagle lives up to his reputation as a &#x201c;contrary warrior&#x201d; by disproving the popular view of Indian boarding schools as bleak and prisonlike.</p> <p>Fortunate Eagle attended Pipestone between 1935 and 1945, just as Commissioner of Indian Affairs John Collier&#x2019;s pluralist vision was reshaping the federal boarding school system to promote greater respect for Native cultures and traditions. But this book is hardly a dry history of the late boarding school era. Telling this story in the voice of his younger self, the author takes us on a delightful journey into his childhood and the inner world of the boarding school. Along the way, he shares anecdotes of dormitory culture, student pranks, and warrior games. Although Fortunate Eagle recognizes Pipestone&#x2019;s shortcomings, he describes his time there as nothing less than &#x201c;a little bit of heaven.&#x201d;</p> <p>Were all Indian boarding schools the dispiriting places that history has suggested? This book allows readers to decide for themselves.</p></p><p><b>Adam Fortunate Eagle</b> is an Ojibwe artist, writer, and frequent guest lecturer. As an advocate for Native civil rights throughout his life, he was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters from the State University of New York, New Paltz.

Hauptman</b> is Distinguished Professor Emeritus of History in the State University of New York, College at New Paltz, and the author of several books on the Iroquois in New York state.</p>Gr 9 Up&#x2013;Adam Fortunate Eagle entered the Pipestone Indian Training School at the age of six. From that time until his graduation at age 16, he spent each school year and many summers under the care of the teachers and wardens at Pipestone. Growing up with other children, some sent by their families and others enrolled as orphans, Fortunate Eagle experienced the loneliness of separation, the camaraderie of school life, and the absence of his culture. While traditional practices were not forbidden, neither were they taught. Piecing together his heritage through hunting excursions, visits to nearby Native families, summer trips home, and the thoughts and ideas of his schoolmates, Fortunate Eagle eventually matured into a proud, resourceful, well-educated young man. This journey, told through his spare narrative, is filled with school pranks, tender memories, and a growing sense of the world at large between 1935 and 1945. While his account does not follow the general bias against this boarding-school system, the author acknowledges its shortcomings. Brief language and bare, honest descriptions of adolescence add strength and truth to the story, making Pipestone well suited to high school readers. Fortunate Eagle's memories of his time in an Indian boarding school fill a vital need in the canon of available literature about the American Indian experience.<i>Sara Saxton, Tuzzy Consortium Library, Barrow, AK</i><br>� Copyright 2010.

With each passing year, the treatment of sexual problems seems to emphasize more medical and pharmacological interventions. There is correspondingly less interest in the experiences of the individuals or couples involved.&nbsp;This book expands the definition of our field.</p> <p>Part I highlights the major problems and criticisms facing sex therapy and furnishes a rationale for new directions. Included in this new edition are critiques of "sexual addiction" nomenclature, the neglect of the ethical dimension in sex therapy, and there is a call to expand our vision of what sex therapy can attain. Part II demonstrates new approaches to dealing with traditional sex therapy concerns, including lack of desire and erectile dysfunction as well as innovative goals, such as integrating sexual medicine with sex therapy, using client feedback to customize therapy for the particular individual/couple's best interests, promoting relationship growth in working with transgender clients, and transcending sexual function/dysfunction to optimize erotic intimacy in long-term couples. This 2nd edition of <em>New Directions in Sex Therapy: Innovations and Alternatives</em> is replete with helpful new clinical illustrations across the spectrum of theoretical orientations (e.g., systemic, narrative, Experiential, CBT) to demonstrate these approaches in action. </p> <p>This book is intended for anyone who deals with sexual issues and concerns in therapy&#x2013;clinicians of every kind, novices and advanced practitioners&#x2013;rather than only those who define themselves as sex therapists.</p></p><p><strong>Peggy J.

It is a remarkable story of love, of the sanctuary and tyranny of the family, and of the consequences of lies and deception, one that lays bare Victorian hypocrisy and sexual double-standards. Shocking to contemporary readers, its radical utopian vision of "a pure woman faithfully presented" predates Hardy's Tess by nearly forty years. This fully revised and corrected new edition is based on the three-volume first edition of 1853, collated with the one-volume 1855 edition. Tim Dolin's fascinating new introduction challenges the view of <em>Ruth</em> as one of Gaskell's weaker novels and explores its radicalism and cultural influence, highlighting the remarkable story of love, family, and hypocrisy that it tells. In addition, the book includes an up-to-date bibliography, a chronology of Gaskell's life and work, and invaluable notes that shed much light on the book's historical, religious, and literary allusions and points of significance.<br><br><strong>About the Series: </strong>For over 100 years <strong>Oxford World's Classics</strong> has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe.

British novelist ELIZABETH CLEGHORN GASKELL (1810-1865)--whose books were sometimes initially credited to, simply, "Mrs. Gaskell"--is now recognized as having created some of the most complex and progressive depictions of women in the literature of the age, and is today justly celebrated for her precocious use of the regional dialect and slang of England's industrial North. <p> Ruth--Gaskell's third novel, first published in three volumes in 1853--is notable as one of the rare instances in the fiction of the era of a positive portrayal of unwed motherhood and for its thematic condemnation of the social stigma of illegitimacy. The tale of a young woman seduced and abandoned by her lover, then taken in and protected by a kindly minister and his sister, it is remarkably progressive for the period. </p><p> Friend and literary companion to the likes of Charles Dickens and Charlotte Bront�--the latter of whom Gaskell wrote an acclaimed 1857 biography--Gaskell is today being restored to her rightful place alongside them.

Many writers have understood colonial rule as either "direct" (French) or "indirect" (British), with a third variant--apartheid--as exceptional. This benign terminology, Mamdani shows, masks the fact that these were actually variants of a despotism. While direct rule denied rights to subjects on racial grounds, indirect rule incorporated them into a "customary" mode of rule, with state-appointed Native Authorities defining custom. By tapping authoritarian possibilities in culture, and by giving culture an authoritarian bent, indirect rule (decentralized despotism) set the pace for Africa; the French followed suit by changing from direct to indirect administration, while apartheid emerged relatively later. Apartheid, Mamdani shows, was actually the generic form of the colonial state in Africa.</p><br><p> Through case studies of rural (Uganda) and urban (South Africa) resistance movements, we learn how these institutional features fragment resistance and how states tend to play off reform in one sector against repression in the other. Reforming a power that institutionally enforces tension between town and country, and between ethnicities, is the key challenge for anyone interested in democratic reform in Africa.</p></p><p>In this provocative analysis of the obstacles to democratization in post-independence Africa, Mahmood Mamdani offers a bold, insightful account of colonialism&#39;s legacy: a bifurcated power that mediated racial domination through tribally organized local authorities, reproducing racial identity in citizens and ethnic identity in subjects.

But it's true: this is indeed one of the most important and influential books ever written, and it is one of the very few groundbreaking works of science that is truly readable.<p> To a certain extent it suffers from the Hamlet problem--it's full of clich�s! Or what are now clich�s, but which Darwin was the first to pen. Natural selection, variation, the struggle for existence, survival of the fittest: it's all in here.</p><p> Darwin's friend and "bulldog" T.H. Huxley said upon reading the <i>Origin</i>, "How extremely stupid of me not to have thought of that." Alfred Russel Wallace had thought of the same theory of evolution Darwin did, but it was Darwin who gathered the mass of supporting evidence--on domestic animals and plants, on variability, on sexual selection, on dispersal--that swept most scientists before it. It's hardly necessary to mention that the book is still controversial: Darwin's remark in his conclusion that "Light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history" is surely the pinnacle of British understatement. <i>--Mary Ellen Curtin</i></p>Jim Endersby&#39;s major new scholarly edition debunks some of the myths that surround Darwin&#39;s book, and expores how it was originally written, published and read. Endersby provides a new, up-to-date and very readable introduction to this classic text and a level of scholarly apparatus unmatched by any other edition.</p><h2>An Introduction to Student-Involved Assessment FOR Learning (6th Edition)</h2><p><p>Written for pre-service teacher candidates who have little or no classroom experience, Rick Stiggins&#x2019; multiple award-winning and market-leading text focuses squarely on preparing new teachers to assess students in classrooms, providing them with their initial orientation to classroom assessment and to the challenges they will face in monitoring student learning, in using the assessment process, and its results to benefit their students. The text clearly instructs teaching candidates on how to gather dependable evidence of student learning using quality assessments and how to use those assessments to support and to certify student learning. The book has an exceptionally strong focus on integrating assessment with instruction through student involvement in the assessment process; it is clearly the most non-technical and hands on practical orientation to assessment validity and reliability yet developed. It offers five easy-to-understand keys to effective classroom assessment practice that any teacher can learn to apply. The presentation covers the full range of classroom assessment methods, when and how to use them and how to communicate results in ways that support learning.&nbsp; Examples and models are offered across grade levels and schools subjects to assist candidates in learning these things. The treatment of student-involved assessment, record keeping, and communication as an instructional intervention is a unique entity of the text.&nbsp; Specific assessment strategies are offered throughout for helping students see the learning target from the beginning and then watch themselves move progressively close over time until they achieve ultimate learning success. Showing how to use assessment to accurately reflect student achievement and how to benefit&#x2013;not merely grade&#x2013;student learning, the text examines the full spectrum of assessment topics, from articulating targets, through developing quality assessments and communicating results effectively. &nbsp; </p></p><p><p>A multiple award-winning text, this is the market-leader for assessment courses.

He gingerly extracted a fat pair of angry crustaceans from the trap, pegged the claws and tossed the lobsters into a holding tank, then he rebaited the trap with a fish head, pushed the wire cage over the side and went into the pilothouse for his binoculars. He peered through the lenses and silently mouthed the word "Wow!"</p><p>The ship was huge. Jenkins examined the vessel from stem to stern with an expert eye. Before retiring to take up lobster-fishing, he had taught oceanography for years at the University of Maine, and he had spent many summer breaks on survey ships-but this vessel was like nothing he had ever seen. He estimated its length at about six hundred feet. Derricks and cranes sprouted from its deck. Jenkins guessed it was some sort of ocean mining or exploration vessel. He watched until the ship vanished from sight, then went back to pull the rest of the string of pots.</p><p>Jenkins was a tall, rangy man in his sixties, whose rugged features mirrored the rockbound coast of his native Maine. A smile crossed his deeply tanned face as he hauled in the last trap. It had been an exceptionally good day. He had found the honey hole by accident a couple of months earlier. The spot produced an endless supply of lobsters, and he kept coming back even though he had to go farther from land than normal. Fortunately, his thirty-six-foot wooden boat was seaworthy even with a full load. Setting a course for land, he put the boat on autopilot and went below to reward himself with what they used to call a Dagwood sandwich when he was a kid. He had just layered in another slice of baloney on top of the pile of ham, cheese and salami when he heard a muffled "Boom!" It sounded like a thunderclap, but it seemed to come from below.</p><p>The boat shuddered so violently the jars of mustard and mayonnaise rolled off the counter. Jenkins tossed his knife in the sink and sprang up to the deck. He wondered if the propeller had broken off or if he had hit a floating log, but nothing seemed amiss. The sea was calm and almost flat. Earlier, the blue surface had reminded him of a Rothko canvas.</p><p>The boat had stopped vibrating, and he took a wondering look around, then, shrugging, went below. He finished making his sandwich, cleaned up and went out on the deck to eat. Noticing a couple of lobster traps that had shifted, he secured them with a line, then as he stepped back into the wheelhouse, he experienced a sudden unpleasant stomach-sinking sensation, as if someone had pushed the Up button in a fast elevator. He grabbed onto the mechanical hauler to keep his footing. The boat plunged, then levitated again, higher this time, plummeted once more and repeated the cycle a third time before sinking back into the sea, where it rocked violently from side to side.</p><p>After a few minutes, the motion stopped and the boat stabilized, and Jenkins saw a flickering movement in the distance. Retrieving his binoculars from the wheelhouse, he swept the sea, and as he adjusted the focus ring, he saw three dark furrows extending from north to south. The ranks of waves were moving in the direction of the coast. A long-dormant alarm bell clanged in his head. It can't be. His mind raced back to that July day in 1998 off the coast of Papua New Guinea. He had been on a ship, making a survey, when there had been a mysterious explosion and the seismic instruments had gone crazy, indicating a disturbance on the seafloor. Recognizing the symptoms of a tsunami, the scientists aboard the ship had tried to warn the coast, but many of the villages had no communication. The huge waves had flattened the villages like a giant steamroller. The destruction was horrifying. Jenkins never forgot the sight of bodies impaled on mangrove branches, of crocodiles preying on the dead.</p><p>The radio crackled with a chorus of hard-edged Maine accents as fishermen set the airways abuzz. "Whoa!" said a voice Jenkins recognized as that of his neighbor, Elwood Smalley. "Hear that big boomer?"</p><p>"Sounded like a jet fighter, only underwater," another fisherman said.</p><p>"Anyone else feel those big seas?" said a third man.</p><p>"Yup," replied a laconic veteran lobsterman named Homer Gudgeon. "Thought for a time there I was on a roller coaster!"</p><p>Jenkins barely heard the other voices chiming in. He dug a pocket calculator out of a drawer, estimated the time between the waves and their height, did some quick calculations and glanced with disbelief at the numbers. Then he picked up the cell phone he used when he didn't want personal messages to go over the marine channel and punched out a number.</p><p>The gravelly voice of Charlie Howes, Rocky Cove's police chief, came on the phone.</p><p>"Charlie, thank God I got you!"</p><p>"In my cruiser on my way to the station, Roy. You calling to crow about whippin' me at chess last night?"</p><p>"Another time," Jenkins said. "I'm east of Rocky Point. Look, Charlie, we don't have much time. There's a big wave heading right toward town."</p><p>He heard a dry chuckle at the other end. "Hell, Roy," the chief said, "town like ours on the water is bound to get lots of waves."</p><p>"Not like this one. You've got to evacuate the people from near the harbor, especially the new motel."</p><p>Jenkins thought the phone had gone dead. Then came Charlie Howe's famous guffaw. "I didn't know today was April Fool's."</p><p>"Charlie, this is no joke," Jenkins said in exasperation. "That wave is going to slam into the harbor. I don't know how strong it will be, because there are lots of unknowns, but that motel is right in its path."</p><p>The chief laughed again. "Hell, some people would be real happy to see the Harbor View washed into the sea."</p><p>The two-story edifice that extended into the harbor on stilts had been a source of controversy for months. It had gone up only after a bitter fight, an expensive lawsuit filed by the developers and what many suspected were bribes to officials.</p><p>"They're going to get their wish, but you've got to get the guests out first."</p><p>"Hell, Roy, there must be a hundred people staying there. I can't roust them out for no reason. I'll lose my job. Even worse, I'll be a laughingstock."</p><p>Jenkins checked his watch and cursed under his breath. He hadn't wanted to panic the chief, but he had reached the end of his self-control.</p><p>"Goddamnit, you old fool! How will you feel if a hundred people die because you're afraid of being laughed at?"</p><p>"You're not kidding, are you, Roy?"</p><p>"You know what I did before I took up lobstering."</p><p>"Yeah, you were a professor at the university up at Orono."</p><p>"That's right. I headed up the Oceanography Department. We studied wave action. You've heard of the Perfect Storm? You've got the perfect tidal wave heading your way. I calculate it will hit in twenty-five minutes. I don't care what you tell those motel people. Tell them there's a gas leak, a bomb threat, anything. Just get them out and to higher ground. And do it now."</p><p>"Okay, Roy. Okay."</p><p>"Is there anything open on Main Street?"</p><p>"Coffee shop. Jacoby kid is on the night shift. I'll have him swing by, then check out the fish pier."</p><p>"Make sure everybody is out of the area in fifteen minutes. That goes for you and Ed Jacoby."</p><p>"Will do. Thanks, Roy. I think. 'Bye."</p><p>Jenkins was almost dizzy with tension. He pictured Rocky Point in his mind. The town of twelve hundred was built like the seats in an amphitheater, its houses clustered on the side of a small hill overlooking the roughly circular harbor. The harbor was relatively sheltered, but the town's inhabitants had learned after a couple of hurricane-driven storm surges to build back from the water. The old brick maritime buildings on the main street bordering the harbor had been given over to shops and restaurants that served tourists. The fish pier and the motel dominated the harbor. Jenkins cranked up the throttle and prayed that his warning had arrived in time.</p><p><br>CHIEF Howes immediately regretted agreeing to Roy's urgent pleas, and was overcome by a numbing sense of uncertainty. Damned if he did, damned if he didn't. He'd known Jenkins since they were kids and Roy was the smartest one in class. He had never known him to fail as a friend. Still. Oh hell, he was near retirement anyhow.</p><p>Howes switched on his flasher, nailed the accelerator and, with a smoky screech of tires, roared toward the waterfront. While he drove the short distance, he got the deputy on the radio and told him to clear out the coffee shop then to go along Main Street with his PA system blasting, warning people to get to high ground. The chief knew the diurnal rhythms of his town: who would be up, who would be walking a dog. Luckily, most businesses didn't open before ten.</p><p>The motel was another story. Howes pulled over two empty buses on their way to pick up schoolchildren and told the drivers to follow him. The cruiser squealed to a stop beneath the motel's canopy, and the chief huffed his way to the front door. Howes had been on the fence about the motel. It would spoil the integrity of the harbor, but it might bring in jobs for locals; not everyone in town wanted to be a fisherman. On the other hand, he didn't like the way the project was rammed through to approval. He couldn't prove it, but he was sure there had been bribes at town hall.</p><p>The developer was a local named Jack Shrager, an unprincipled land raper who was building condos along the river that ran off the harbor, further despoiling the town's quiet beauty. Shrager never did hire locals, preferring foreigners who worked long and cheap.</p><p>The desk clerk, a young Jamaican, looked up with a startled expression on his thin, dark face as the chief burst into the lobby and shouted: "Get everyone out of the motel! This is an emergency!"</p><p>"What's the problem, mon?"</p><p>"I've been told there's a bomb here."</p><p>The desk clerk gulped. Then he got on the switchboard and began to call rooms.</p><p>"You've got ten minutes," Howes emphasized. "There are buses waiting in front. Get everyone out, including yourself. Tell anyone who refuses that the police will arrest them."</p><p>The chief strode down the nearest hallway and pounded on doors. "Police! You must evacuate this building immediately. You have ten minutes," he yelled at the sleepy faces that peered out. "There has been a bomb threat. Don't stop to gather your belongings."</p><p>He repeated the message until he was hoarse. The hallways filled with people in bathrobes and pajamas or with blankets wrapped around them. A swarthy man with an unpleasant scowl on his face stepped from one room. "What the hell is going on?" Jack Shrager demanded.</p><p>Howes swallowed hard. "There's been a bomb threat, Jack. You've got to get out."</p><p>A young blond woman poked her head out of the room. "What's wrong, babe?"</p><p>"There's a bomb in the motel," the chief said, becoming more specific.</p><p>The woman's face went pale and she stepped into the hallway. She was still in her silk bathrobe. Shrager tried to hold her, but she pulled away.</p><p>"I'm not staying here," she said.</p><p>"And I'm not moving," Shrager said. He slammed the door.</p><p>Howes shook his head in frustration, then guided the woman by the arm, joining the throng heading for the front door. He saw the buses were almost filled and yelled at the drivers.</p><p>"Get out of here in five minutes. Drive to the highest hill in town."</p><p>He slid behind the wheel of his cruiser and drove to the fish pier. The deputy was arguing with three fishermen. Howes saw what was happening and yelled out the window, "Get your asses into those trucks and go to the top of Hill Street or you'll be arrested."</p><p>"What the hell is going on, Charlie?"</p><p>Howes lowered his voice. "Look, Buck, you know me. Just do as I say and I'll explain later."</p><p>The fisherman nodded, then he and the others got into their pickups. Howes told his deputy to follow them and made one last sweep along the fish pier, where he picked up an elderly man who sorted through the rubbish bins for cans and bottles. Then he scoured Main Street, saw that it was quiet and headed for the top of Hill Street.</p><p>Some of the people who stood shivering in the cool air of morning shouted at him. Howes ignored their insults, got out of his cruiser and walked partway down the steep hill that led down toward the harbor. Now that the adrenaline rush was over, he felt weak-kneed. Nothing. He checked his watch. Five minutes came and went. And so did his dreams of a peaceful retirement on a police pension. I'm dead, he thought, sweating despite the coolness.</p><p>Then he saw the sea rise above the horizon and heard what sounded like distant thunder. The townspeople stopped shouting. A darkness loomed out near the channel entrance and the harbor emptied out-he could actually see bottom-but the phenomenon lasted only a few seconds. The water roared back in with a noise like a 747 taking off, and the sea lifted the moored fishing boats as if they were toys. It was reinforced by two more waves, seconds apart, each taller than the one before. They surged over the shore. When they receded, the motel and the fish pier had vanished.</p><p><br>THE Rocky Point that Jenkins returned to was far different from the one he had left that morning. The boats moored in the harbor were jumbled together along the shore in a tangled heap of wood and fiberglass. Smaller craft had been thrown up onto Main Street. Shop windows were smashed as if by a gang of vandals. The water was littered with debris and seaweed, and a sulfuric smell of sea bottom mixed with the odor of dead fish. The motel had vanished. Only pilings remained of the fish pier, although the sturdy concrete bulkhead showed no sign of damage. Jenkins pointed his boat toward a figure waving his arms on the bulkhead. Chief Howes grabbed the mooring lines and tied them off, then he stepped aboard.</p><p>"Anybody hurt?" Jenkins said, his eyes sweeping the harbor and town.</p><p>"Jack Shrager was killed. He's the only one as far as we know. We got everyone else out of the motel."</p><p>"Thanks for believing me. Sorry I called you an old fool."</p><p>The chief puffed his cheeks out. "That's what I would have been if I'd sat on my ass and done nothing."</p><p>"Tell me what you saw," Jenkins said, the scientist reasserting itself over the Samaritan.</p><p>Howes laid out the details. "We were standing at the top of Hill Street. Sounded and looked like a thunderstorm, then the harbor emptied out like a kid pulling the plug in a bathtub. I could actually see bottom. That only lasted a few seconds before the water roared in like a jet plane."</p><p>"That's an apt comparison. On the open ocean, a tsunami can go six hundred miles an hour."</p><p>"That's fast!" the chief said.</p><p>"Luckily, it slows down as it approaches land and hits shallower water. But the wave energy doesn't diminish with the speed."</p><p>"It wasn't like I pictured. You know, a wall of water fifty feet high. This was more like a wave surge. I counted three of them, each bigger than the last. Thirty feet, maybe. They whacked the motel and pier and flooded Main Street." He shrugged. "I know you'...</p></p><h2>Cracking the Sales Management Code: The Secrets to Measuring and Managing Sales Performance</h2><p><i>Cracking the Sales Management Code</i> is a groundbreaking book for sales managers and executives who want greater control over sales performance.

It inspired geographical and commercial exploration ,as traders pursued such common spices as pepper and cinnamon and rarer aromatic products, including ambergris and musk. Ultimately, the spice quest led to imperial missions that were to change world history.</p><p>This engaging book explores the demand for spices: why were they so popular, and why so expensive?&nbsp; Paul Freedman surveys the history, geography, economics, and culinary tastes of the Middle Ages to uncover the surprisingly varied ways that spices were put to use--in elaborate medieval cuisine, in the treatment of disease, for the promotion of well-being, and to perfume important ceremonies of the Church.

For example, in &#x201c;The Goatherd and the Goat&#x201d; we learn that there is no use trying to hide what can&#x2019;t be hidden. In &#x201c;The Ass and the Purchaser&#x201d; we find that people are known by the company they keep. In &#x201c;The Boys and the Frogs,&#x201d; one person&#x2019;s pleasure may be another person&#x2019;s pain. &#x201c;The Dogs and the Fox&#x201d; show how easy it is to kick a man when he&#x2019;s down.

Bogle</strong> <br><table> <tbody><tr> <td></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Author John C. Bogle </td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p><b>In <i>Don&#x2019;t Count on It</i>, you discuss how we deceive ourselves, particularly with numbers. Can you describe what you consider to be the absolute worst illusion investors fall prey to?</b><br> The most damaging illusion for investors is their belief that they capture the stock market's return. For example, if the stock market provides an annual return of 7%, we know that the average investor's return will fall short of that by the amount of fees they pay. Those fees amount to about 2.5% annually for the typical investor, so their net return is down to 4.5%. Taxes might knock another 1% off of that, reducing the investor's annual return to 3.5% -- just half of the market's return. If you compound those figures over 50 years, $1 grows by $4.60 at 3.5%, and by $28.50 at 7%. In other words, the investor's cumulative return is less than 20% of the market's return. That's an enormous gap; one that can easily mean the difference between achieving one's long-term financial goals and falling well short of them.</p> <p><b>If you could change just one thing about the practice of capitalism today, what would it be, and why is it the most important? </b><br> The biggest problem with capitalism today is our tremendous focus on the short-term. Institutional investors--who own 70% of our corporations--are predominantly concerned with whether or not the quarterly earnings of the companies they own will meet the stock market's expectations. As a result, our corporate managers move heaven and earth to try to meet those targets, so as to keep their firm's stock price high and maximize their stock-based compensation. But building corporate value over the long-term is hard; there are no quick or easy shortcuts. And as the past decade has demonstrated, decisions made to boost earnings and stock prices in the short-term tend to end up destroying shareholder value over the long-term. The sooner we can realign our focus from the short-term to the long-term, the better for all concerned. </p> <p><b>What do you think about ETFs? </b><br> I like some; I am appalled by others. Specifically, I favor low cost ETFs that are focused on broadly diversified portfolios of stocks and bonds that investors can hold for a lifetime. These ETFs should provide investors with their fair share of whatever the returns our financial markets will provide. That's a winner's game.</p> <p>On the other hand, I'm not happy with ETFs--the vast majority--that exist to enable investors to speculate, to play their hunches on which country or market sector will outperform or underperform over the short term. The turnover rates are enormous, holding periods are measured in mere days, and costs are far higher than those levied by broad market ETFs. That kind of speculation is a loser's game. So I believe that ETFs have the potential to play a significant role in the portfolios of long-term investors. Unfortunately, to this point their use seems to be dominated by those engaged in far more destructive investment approaches.</p> <p><b>You talk about inspiring the next generation of leaders and your mentors in <i>Don&#x2019;t Count on It</i>. What did your mentors have in common that you think is the most important trait in inspiring young people today? In other words, how can each of us be better mentors? </b><br> I think at the most basic level, my mentors were good people; men of strong character who loved their work. They realized that the work they did made a difference in people's lives, and they did that work with a great deal of ability, pride, and professionalism. They woke up every day and tried their best to make the world a little bit better. That's what I took away from the relationships I had with my mentors, and the extent that I've been able to emulate them, I think, explains a great deal of what I've been able to accomplish in my own career.</p> <p>My views on mentoring have a lot in common with the themes of <i>Don't Count on It</i>. That is, these relationships are largely built upon trust, and attempts to quantify them are doomed to failure. Mentoring, in my mind, is less about helping someone fill out a checklist of accomplishments, and much more about passing along the immeasurable qualities one needs to be successful in their field --character, professionalism, honesty, intellectual curiosity, even humor. If you possess sufficient amounts of those characteristics, you're likely to be successful in whatever field you work in.</p><br> <b>Praise for <i>Don't Count On It!</i></b> <p> "This collection of Jack Bogle's writings couldn't be more timely.

Blinder writes, "America's vaunted financial system let us down big-time during the raucous decade of the 2000s." In Don't Count on It!, John C. Bogle&#x2014;a man Dr. Blinder refers to as "the conscience of Wall Street"&#x2014;identifies modern capitalism's flaws, explains how we arrived at this economic crossroads, and examines how we can begin to repair the damage before it's too late.</p> <p>Don't Count on It! presents an anthology of Bogle's latest thinking, focused on how numbers deceive us into seeing things as other than they really are. He also presents a cogent analysis of the chinks in the armor of a financial system that has failed to live up to the responsibility owed to its individual and institutional investors.</p> <p>Read and learn from the wise counsel of Vanguard's founder about how we deceive ourselves into accepting illusory and evanescent numbers rather than focusing on fundamental and intrinsic reality. Bogle argues that we confuse the market of real investing with the market of expectations, disregarding the beauty of simplicity in favor of the wizardry that creates complex "products" that serve Wall Street at the expense of its clients. Specifically, Bogle discusses:</p> <ul> <li> <p>The unconscionably high costs of financial intermediation</p> </li> <li> <p>The disgraceful failure of money managers and agents to abide by what should have been traditional fiduciary standards</p> </li> <li> <p>The unfortunate consequences of the dominance of short-term speculation over long-term investment</p> </li> </ul> <p>The subjects of Bogle's anthology go well beyond the investment markets, as indicated by the seven sections of Don't Count on It!&#x2014;Investment Illusions, The Failure of Capitalism, What's Wrong with "Mutual" Funds, What's Right with Indexing, Entrepreneurship and Innovation, Idealism and the New Generation, and Heroes and Mentors.</p> <p>His book encourages readers to better understand our complex financial system, to examine it, to debate it, to challenge it, and to fulfill our duty to ask simple questions and demand answers that are understandable, intelligent, and, above all, wise.</p></p><h2>Hideyoshi (Harvard East Asian Monographs)</h2><p><p>Here is the first full-length biography in English of the most important political figure in premodern Japan.</p><p>Hideyoshi&#x2015;peasant turned general, military genius, and imperial regent of Japan&#x2015;is the subject of an immense legendary literature. He is best known for the conquest of Japan&#x2019;s sixteenth-century warlords and the invasion of Korea. He is known, too, as an extravagant showman who rebuilt cities, erected a colossal statue of the Buddha, and entertained thousands of guests at tea parties. But his lasting contribution is as governor whose policies shaped the course of Japanese politics for almost three hundred years.</p><p>In Japan&#x2019;s first experiment with federal rule, Hideyoshi successfully unified two hundred local domains under a central authority. Mary Elizabeth Berry explores the motives and forms of this new federalism which would survive in Japan until the mid-nineteenth century, as well as the philosophical question it raised: What is the proper role of government? This book reflects upon both the shifting political consciousness of the late sixteenth century and the legitimation rituals that were invoked to place change in a traditional context. It also reflects upon the architect of that change&#x2015;a troubled parvenu who acted often with moderation and sometimes with explosive brutality.</p></p><p>Mary Elizabeth Berry is Class of 1944 Professor of History at the University of California, Berkeley.&#x201c;Elizabeth Berry&#x2019;s <i>Hideyoshi</i> is the first truly scholarly comprehensive or readable account in English of a man who was probably the most extraordinary and significant political figure in the world during the sixteenth century.

Yes, this is the fifth edition (not a typo, the typos come later in the book). It&#x2019;s so nice to have you here on page one. I&#x2019;m Harlan. I&#x2019;ll be your Naked author and host throughout this book. I&#x2019;ve included a picture of myself on the back of the book (fully clothed) so you can see what I look like. And yes, I&#x2019;ve actually been wearing that same outfit while writing this entire book (but I have gained about five pounds). As your host and author, I&#x2019;d like to offer you something to eat or drink (nonalcoholic), but I don&#x2019;t know where to find you or if you can eat or drink where you are. If you&#x2019;re reading this at a place where they&#x2019;re serving food or drinks, please get yourself something. I can&#x2019;t pay for it, but if I were there, I would. I just want to make sure that you&#x2019;re comfortable.</p> <p>So please, slip off your shoes, unbutton the top button on your pants if they&#x2019;re snug, find a comfortable place to sit if you&#x2019;re standing. Do whatever it takes for you to get comfortable, as long as what you need to do to get comfortable isn&#x2019;t prohibited by any indecency laws. If it is prohibited, please take this book home with you. I&#x2019;m not trying to get you to buy it (well, maybe I am a little), but what is more important than your owning this book is that you are as comfortable as possible while reading it. Because when it comes down to it, that&#x2019;s what this whole book is all about&#x2015;and it&#x2019;s really what the college experience is about. It&#x2019;s about helping you to get comfortable for what can be an uncomfortable (at times) journey ahead. Now, I&#x2019;ll give you a break to get comfortable. And please, feel free to browse through the book after you settle in.</p> <p>&#x2015;A BREAK IN THE BOOK&#x2015;</p> <p>Welcome Back</p> <p>Hi, Harlan here again, your author and host. From browsing through this book, you are probably expecting a lot of tips. When it comes to &#x201c;tips,&#x201d; there are many different kinds in the world. There are good tips, bad tips, informative tips, tips that touch the surface, tips that give you something to think about, tips you leave on a table after eating at a restaurant, rib tips, fingertips, tiptoes, and various other miscellaneous tips. This is a tip book unlike any other tip book. It&#x2019;s a book that goes far beyond the tip and leaves you with something to think about, and when applicable, even offers you places to go for help on and off campus. I&#x2019;d like to go so far as to say that this is the best tip book in the history of tip books. (Minus the 1762 classic, Ten Tips for Settlers to the New Country. I do love that book.)</p> <p>This might come to you as a surprise, but I wasn&#x2019;t a fan of &#x201c;tip books&#x201d;&#x2015;that is, until I wrote this book. I don&#x2019;t just like this one because I wrote it (although that is part of the reason). It&#x2019;s because this book is genuinely different. It&#x2019;s based on what today&#x2019;s college students are honestly thinking, feeling, and doing on today&#x2019;s college campuses. It&#x2019;s their voices sharing their stories and experiences that will expose the uncensored truth about what&#x2019;s really going on in college. Not only will you get page after page of telling tips from students on over one hundred college campuses across North America, you&#x2019;ll also get the latest facts, stats, resources, support services having to do with college life, and some advice from me&#x2015;someone who has been a freshman twice, has visited over four hundred college campuses, and has interviewed over a thousand students. Whether you&#x2019;re living on campus or commuting from home, whether you&#x2019;re going to a big school or a small school, whether you&#x2019;re the first person in your family going to college or the last&#x2015;I&#x2019;ve made sure that this book has something for everyone.</p> <p>About the student-offered tips&#x2015;one thing that I&#x2019;ve discovered while writing my syndicated Help Me, Harlan! advice column and interviewing students over the years is that it&#x2019;s the rest of the story, the story of how someone came up with his or her tip or advice, that is the most telling. And that&#x2019;s exactly what you&#x2019;ll find here&#x2015;the tips and the stories behind them. That&#x2019;s just not something you see every day. (Assuming you own this book, you now can see it every day if that&#x2019;s what you enjoy doing with your spare time.)</p> <p>Speaking of time, I appreciate yours. I promise not to waste it. This book will be helpful. At the very least, it can always be used as a doorstop, a coaster, or a way to level out a shaky table. The actual information written on the pages of your new doorstop/coaster/level will also prove helpful. Whether you&#x2019;re heading to a college down the street or across the country, this book has something for you. Whether you&#x2019;re headed to college as the star of your high school or you&#x2019;re one of those students who blended into the cement block walls in the back of your classroom, this book has something for you. And that includes all those people who fall somewhere in between blending into the cement blocks and being a star. Whether you&#x2019;re attending a two-year school, a four-year school, or a virtual school, this book is written with you in mind. Whether you&#x2019;re from the United States, Canada, Spain, Australia, Austria, India, China, or a country I haven&#x2019;t mentioned, The Naked Roommate is also for you. This is the book that I only wish someone had written for me when I went to college. In fact, this book has proven so helpful over the years that it&#x2019;s now being used as required reading, as a textbook, and as a training guide for student leaders on campus. In addition, there&#x2019;s now a Naked Roommate&#x2019;s First Year Survival Workbook and an online instructor&#x2019;s guide to go along with the book.</p> <p>While high schools do a great job of getting students into college, once on campus, few students know what to expect. That&#x2019;s what this book is all about&#x2015;to help you expect the unexpected so that when the unexpected shows up, it won&#x2019;t be so hard to handle. When I went to college, I thought it was going to be an easy transition. I had two older brothers who had both been to college (one is five years older, the other eight years older). I also had a long-distance girlfriend who was a senior in high school. I went to a big university after graduating from a big high school, and expected everything to just fall into place. But instead, I only felt out of place. It took almost two semesters and my transferring from the University of Wisconsin at Madison (an awesome school) to Indiana University in Bloomington, Indiana (another awesome school), to figure it all out. At IU, I experienced a second freshman year and realized there&#x2019;s so much no one tells us about life in college. That&#x2019;s why I wrote this book&#x2015;to share all the things that no one ever tells you about your college years, things that will make college life easier to handle. Whether on a commuter campus, a college near home, or a university far away from home, so much of what students experience during the college years is universal. It&#x2019;s a higher education in love, in life, and in finding passion&#x2015;inside and outside the classroom.</p> <p>I&#x2019;m so happy that you finally have your hands on The Naked Roommate. I hope you will keep this close to you through your college career. You might not need everything on the pages to follow today, but you&#x2019;ll use different parts of The Naked Roommate (and the Survival Workbook) during different times throughout your college career. When you do need it, it&#x2019;s here. I know it will help.</p> <p>Please note&#x2015;you probably won&#x2019;t encounter every single issue and obstacle discussed in this book (and if you do, you should write your own book). That said, you will encounter many of them, if not in your own life, then in the lives of your friends. When that happens, you can share this book or get them their own copies. One thing I should mention before continuing: I promised many of the college students who offered advice for this book not to just talk about the bad parts of college; they didn&#x2019;t want this book to scare you, because the truth is that most of life in college is great. It&#x2019;s just once in a while it&#x2019;s not great. And that&#x2019;s what this book is here for. To help make it great even in the not so great times. And with that, I&#x2019;ve fulfilled my promise.</p> <p>As you read this book and live out your own college experience, please send in your thoughts, tips, and stories.

MY SECOND WIFE<p></p> <br>She is closer to me than my shadow. She&#x2019;s as precious as the sky. In my almost empty Brooklyn apartment, my second wife, Chiasa, aimed and then fired sharpened knives into the corked wall. I had taken everything out of this place, but the cork seemed permanent to my project bedroom. It had served as my target practice for seven years and unlike me and my family, it did not want to leave.<br> <br>&#x201c;Go stand over there for me,&#x201d; she said sweetly. As she locked her silver-gray eyes into mine, I looked at her and said nothing. My smile broke out naturally. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t smile at me,&#x201d; she said with a straight face. &#x201c;Every time it&#x2019;s time for us to fight you flash that smile.&#x201d;<br> <br>She must not have figured out that she brought that smile out of me, and so much more. It was because of my love for her that I held onto the keys to this place, where I wouldn&#x2019;t even allow my mother, Umma; my first wife, Akemi; or my sister, Naja to ever again step foot.<br> <br>I walked to the corked wall like she wanted. I leaned back, my hands in my Girbaud jean pockets. She narrowed her eyes and hurled a knife at me. It cut through the still stale air that was typical in the projects and sliced through my fitted. I didn&#x2019;t flinch. She saw that, and inside of seven seconds she outlined my head and shoulders with eight knives rapidly fired by her quick and accurate combination of eyes and fingers.<br> <br>&#x201c;You going to kill me, with my own knives?&#x201d; I asked her. She walked towards me slowly until only noses separated her and me. She pulled each knife down from the cork.<br> <br>&#x201c;Now you do me,&#x201d; she said, handing me the knives. Her breasts pressed against my chest, and her unusually long lashes brushed against mine. The last thing on my mind was taking aim at her with a weapon, and she knew it.<br> <br>Chiasa, my second wife, is a badass, a flawless-skinned, pretty-faced, thick-haired, doe-eyed, ballerina-bodied, ninjutsu-trained warrior. Pretty and precise, she is disciplined to the extreme, same as me. Yet, she is the only one alive who could move me off point, cause me to temporarily lose my balance and have to check myself. The unusual combination of her deep fiery soul, her soft-spoken manner, her sharp mind, her vibrant energy and exquisite body, topped off by the intensity of her loyalty, moved me continuously and I couldn&#x2019;t keep off of her.<br> <br>It had gotten to the point where she sometimes had me questioning things and matters I had never questioned myself about before. Boldly, she had become a Muslim woman at age sixteen. She accepted Islam on her own, without me asking her to do it or having to recite her any truths from the Holy Quran. She reads the Quran for herself, loves each sura she studies and each ayat she learns. She uses every word in the book to challenge herself to become more beautiful in her wisdom and her deeds. For her to love the faith like any Muslim born on Islamic land and raised with the Muslim example and lifestyle surrounding her made her irresistible to me.<br> <br>When anyone in her family tried to reverse Chiasa&#x2019;s mind, she would politely and calmly reveal her angles of thought and her contentment. Once, one of her aunts said in front of her whole family, &#x201c;A Muslim man can only have more than one wife if he can treat them all equally. No man can treat two, three, four women equally, so that means he can really only have one wife. You&#x2019;re supposed to be smart enough to figure it out. It&#x2019;s like a riddle,&#x201d; her aunt said.<br> <br>Chiasa answered softly, correcting her aunt&#x2019;s interpretation . . . &#x201c;Treat us each &#x2018;fairly.&#x2019; No woman wants to be treated &#x2018;equal&#x2019; to another, because we are each different. We each enjoy our man in our own way. We each have our own thoughts, likes, dislikes, and hobbies. I don&#x2019;t want my husband to do the exact &#x2018;equal&#x2019; thing he does with his first wife with me; or to give me the exact &#x2018;equal&#x2019; gifts he gave her. Why would I want that? I just want him to love me how I, Chiasa, want to be loved. Us sharing the things that are unique to what we feel when we are together. I want us to enjoy and make each other feel good, because we believe the same things. I want us to learn, earn, and fight together, to be safe, secure, and happy. This is more than enough for me.&#x201d;<br> <br>Those words she spoke shut her one aunt up for some time. And, I know she meant it. When we first settled into our new home in Queens, the house that Umma and I purchased with the money that we both earned through our company, Umma Designs, Chiasa chose the smallest bedroom for herself. She set her bedding on the floor, the way she was most comfortable. She lined up her books, mounted her swords, folded her clothes, set up her oils, potions, and creams, brushes, hairpins, and combs, and told me, &#x201c;You are definitely welcome. Come whenever you want to see me. You know I&#x2019;m from a military family. I am an expert at waiting.&#x201d;<br> <br>Her words put me at ease. I was always one hundred that I could protect and provide for and love her. I never wavered on that. But she made me certain that although we have a teenage marriage and she is my second wife, who left behind her parents, her country, and her action-packed life of excitement, she had no regrets and that I made her happy. It felt good that even over time she had zero doubt.<br> <br>Now she was touching my nine-millimeter. I had laid it on the kitchen counter away from both of us, and towards the wall. We were in my Brooklyn &#x2019;hood, my old apartment. So of course I kept it close. Her clear-polished, clipped, and curved nails and pretty fingers on the black steel aroused me. But the way she held it revealed she didn&#x2019;t have no experience with the piece. Chiasa is a bow-and-arrow kind of girl, not to be taken lightly. She could fire something into you, to rock you into a temporary sleep or send you all the way to heaven. Perfect vision, when she fires, she met her mark whether it was your brain, your heart, or your family jewels. And she wasn&#x2019;t above poisoning her arrow tip before positioning it just right in her target&#x2019;s jugular. Her target would be coughing up blood, his own veins exploding then choking him.<br> <br>&#x201c;How come you prefer guns?&#x201d; she asked me, playfully. But I could tell she really wanted to know. She wanted to know and feel everything about me. And her inquiries were always subtle and sweet. The way she went about it would have me so open, I&#x2019;d be telling her something I never shared with no one else. She mixed her curiosity and intellect with her seductions, and it was a powerful potion. I knew what she was really asking me, because I know her and her mind. She was thinking, to a ninjutsu warrior, a gun is a weakness, a type of excuse not to use your hands and mind to the furthest degree, to confront any enemy and solve the problem . . . any problem.<br> <br>&#x201c;The gun is the bottom line,&#x201d; I told her. &#x201c;The Japanese don&#x2019;t need them.&#x201d; Japan is the country that my second wife is from. She&#x2019;s African and Japanese, an exotic combination. I plucked her from a pretty place, a popular park in Tokyo that was filled with green fields, flowers, and an alluring forest. In that forest there was only one house. Chiasa lived there with only her grandfather, the park ranger.<br> <br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s peace in your neighborhood and in your country,&#x201d; I told her. &#x201c;Brooklyn brings the noise. Over here there&#x2019;s certain times and situations where even the swiftest mind and hands move too slow.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;This block is not so bad looking. I like all the art on the bricks,&#x201d; she said, referring to the &#x2019;hood graffiti. &#x201c;And it&#x2019;s kind of cool how they&#x2019;re setting up for that block party outside today. The music is loud but it sounds nice, and the people seem like they could become our friends,&#x201d; she said cheerfully. &#x201c;I bet if you didn&#x2019;t suspect them,&#x201d; she said softly, &#x201c;and trusted in them a little bit more . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>I interrupted her. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t sleep. These people will easily give a reasonable man a reason to use his trigger finger.&#x201d;<br> <br>I know that men and women were both created by Allah from one same soul. Yet I also know that men and women are different. Chiasa, the woman, is friendly, loving, emotion filled, and hopeful. Besides, she&#x2019;s foreign to my Brooklyn &#x2019;hood, or any &#x2019;hood for that matter. She&#x2019;s a capable female fighter, but she&#x2019;s also innocent and na�ve and likely to underestimate evil. She and I are married, similar in some ways and in deep love. But I am a man born and trained to observe, detect, and perceive all potential threats. To defend, guard, protect or attack, and eliminate all real enemies who don&#x2019;t understand any language other than the ratta-tat-tat or the boom of my &#x201c;milly.&#x201d; I have killed before, for these same reasons. Chiasa has competed in sword fighting and martial arts and won. She has fought, poisoned, injured, and intercepted some enemies in real-life conflict, but she has never killed.<br> <br>Now that she is my wife, she won&#x2019;t have to. I&#x2019;m here for the sole purpose of protecting and providing for and loving my women, and in the future, for raising my sons to do the same for their women and families, Insha&#x2019;Allah.<br> <br>&#x201c;Guns seem messy,&#x201d; she continued her soft expressions while caressing the steel. &#x201c;They make too much noise.&#x201d; She held it now, with both hands. &#x201c;The silent kill is superior,&#x201d; she said.<br> <br>&#x201c;I have a silencer,&#x201d; I told her. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t leave it lying around. If you get snagged with it, you do seven extra years&#x2014;separate from gun possession charges.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Seven years,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s too long . . . and separate from the other charges . . . that&#x2019;s too much.&#x201d; She retreated to silence for some seconds, returning the gun to its position on the counter and pulling back her palms. Then her eyes shifted from the gloom of that thought.<br> <br>&#x201c;You know what I want?&#x201d; she asked, her eyes searching me now to see if I was giving her question real thought, and if I was sharp enough to guess. I was listening carefully now. I wanted to know all of her wants, everything she wanted right now and even in the future. I would be the one who was getting it for her, eliminating her need to need another human beside me, even her father.<br> <br>&#x201c;A crossbow, have you seen one? It&#x2019;s cleverly designed, a quiet, thorough, neater, cleaner weapon, but still super deadly . . .&#x201d; She sounded like she was describing herself.<br> <br>&#x201c;What would you do with that?&#x201d; I asked her.<br> <br>&#x201c;Run out into the woods,&#x201d; she said. Now she held her pretty arms in position as though she was firing her crossbow. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d climb a mountain, track down the bad guys, monsters and witches or avenge anyone who tried to take what I love.&#x201d;<br> <br>She approached me, then pressed her thick, moist and warm lips onto mine.<br> <br>My tongue moving over her tongue, our heads tilted, and there was only our breathing, sucking, and sincerity mixing with our silence. Her black silk yukata dress was easily released. She knew when she put it on this morning, as we trekked and trained over here to Brooklyn, what we came to do. My place in the projects was more of a hut than a palace. It definitely wasn&#x2019;t the nature-filled, beautifully blossoming gardens and forest where she had lived. This was an all cemented place that couldn&#x2019;t compare to the wilderness that she and I had traveled through together, or to eventually climbing over the mountains of Hokkaido, as we fell in love. I knew her soul still craved all of that adventure we had shared, but I also knew that my hut in the projects was where I am right now, and as long as I am anywhere she would willingly and voluntarily choose to be right beside me.<br> <br>Bare backs and bare butts, we were both in the living room now on the warm hard floor, sitting in the spotlight from the powerful sun. Our sauna was natural. The living room windows were shut tight. Chiasa began gently rocking her pretty thighs from side to side, releasing her subtle scent. I watched, wanted to make her wait, while observing her dark brown nipples swelling on her golden breasts. I knew she wouldn&#x2019;t like me staying still and staring because this was her exclusive time with me alone and she cherished it. She started kicking me playfully. Only our feet fought. I cheated, grabbing hold of her right ankle and dragging her. She began laughing but still tried to leap up with her left. Off-balance, she fell. I broke her fall and now our bodies were entangled. I reached back and snatched from off the floor the cloth belt from her yukata.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh no you don&#x2019;t!&#x201d; She raised her voice playfully at what she smartly suspected she had coming. We tussled. I won. Her hands were now tied behind her back. She liked it. I flipped her, then licked her left nipple, then her right. I pulled back.<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t stop,&#x201d; she whispered. I knew her nipples were super sensitive. I began sucking one nipple and not the other. I moved my hand down her curves and rested it on her waist. &#x201c;Stop playing,&#x201d; she begged. I moved my hand between her thighs and she moaned. I pushed my thickest finger inside and her pussy walls locked around it tightly and thumped rhythmically. When I began kissing her she was breathing hard but still tried to launch a sneak attack and flip me with her feet. I&#x2019;m smiling.<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t smile at me!&#x201d; she said, trying to mount me because I hadn&#x2019;t mounted her. We wrestled. My stiff-as-steel joint didn&#x2019;t give a fuck about the game I was playing. In moments I was deep inside of her, pushing and thrashing and the feeling was so extreme.<br> <br>&#x201c;I love you,&#x201d; her lips passionately pushed out causing me to fuck her the way I knew she needed to be fucked in that moment. We were moving, and feeling and changing positions and postures. Warmer than warm, our emotions were heavy like that and only our breathing was heavier.<br> <br>Our mutual deep attraction, our mutual deep admiration, our mutual deep love, loyalty, and deep affection . . . our mutual faith, feelings, and friendship all exploded and I came pouring into her. She was quiet now, still shaking from her own eruption. She turned on her side to face me. So I faced her, watching her slide her slim finger in the sheen of my sweat.<br> <br>&#x201c;One of us should open that window,&#x201d; she said. Her silky Japanese hairstyle turned into a long, wild African bush, me digging it either way because it&#x2019;s all her. Checking her out I eased up, reminding her that &#x201c;We are both naked.&#x201d; She sat up.<br> <br>&#x201c;I know,&#x201d; she said sweetly. I kissed her, just pushed my lips against hers. Her now relaxed nipples turned into Kalamata olives. In less than one second we were both swelling again and she leapt at me. Her hips spread in my lap and I touched her up until I was doing sit-ups between her thighs. Chiasa, my second wife, was no longer the unknowing virgin I had first met. She was swinging those hips, completely comfortable with our naked bodies. She craved that friction and would have an outburst when her feeling reached an unbearable high. Her voice echoed in my mostly empty apartment where she and I needed to be alone to get wild and dive all the way into our thing.<br> <br>Her second shaking, and I was sure she wasn&#x2019;t done. Athletic and competitive, she has endurance. Yet in her eyes I saw a complete surrendering to me, from a sixteen-years-young feline fighter unaccustomed to surrendering.<br> <br>&#x201c;How come I love you so much?&#x201d; she asked me intensely as if she needed to have an answer from herself. &#x201c;I love you more than Konichi,&#x201d; she said.<br> <br>Konichi is her American mare, a horse her father bought her, which she left behind in Japan after I married her.<br> <br>&#x201c;You love me more than your beast?&#x201d; I smiled, saying it out loud so she could hear how it translated in my ear. She laughed a little too, then...</p><h2>Nabokov: Novels, 1969-1974 (Library of America)</h2><p><b>This Library of America volume is the third of three devoted to Vladimir Nabokov, and contains the evanescent works of his later years.</b><br><br><i>Ada, or Ardor: A Family Chronicle</i>&nbsp;(1969), the longest of Nabokov&#x2019;s novels, is a witty and parodic account of a man&#x2019;s lifelong love for his sister.

The texts of this volume incorporate Nabokov&#39;s penciled corrections in his own copies of his works and correct long-standing errors. They are the most authoritative versions available and have been prepared with the assistance of Dmitri Nabokov, the novelist&#39;s son, and Brian Boyd, Nabokov&#39;s distinguished biographer, who has also contributed notes and detailed chronology of the author&#39;s life based on new research.After a brilliant literary career writing in Russian, <b>Vladimir Nabokov</b>&nbsp;(1899-1977) immigrated to the United States in 1940 and went on to an even more brilliant one in English. Between 1939 and 1974 he wrote the autobiography and eight novels collected by the Library of America in an authoritative three-volume set.<br><br><b>Brian Boyd&nbsp;</b>is a Distinguished Professor in the Department of English at the University of Auckland, New Zealand, and is the author of&nbsp;<i>Nabokov&#x2019;s Pale Fire: The Magic of Artistic Discovery</i>.</p><h2>The Practice of Diaspora: Literature, Translation, and the Rise of Black Internationalism</h2><p><p>A pathbreaking work of scholarship that will reshape our understanding of the Harlem Renaissance, <i>The Practice of Diaspora</i> revisits black transnational culture in the 1920s and 1930s, paying particular attention to links between intellectuals in New York and their Francophone counterparts in Paris. Brent Edwards suggests that diaspora is less a historical condition than a set of practices: the claims, correspondences, and collaborations through which black intellectuals pursue a variety of international alliances.</p><p>Edwards elucidates the workings of diaspora by tracking the wealth of black transnational print culture between the world wars, exploring the connections and exchanges among New York&#x2013;based publications (such as <i>Opportunity</i>, <i>The Negro World</i>, and <i>The Crisis</i>) and newspapers in Paris (such as <i>Les Continents</i>, <i>La Voix des N�gres</i>, and <i>L'Etudiant noir</i>). In reading a remarkably diverse archive--the works of writers and editors from Langston Hughes, Ren� Maran, and Claude McKay to Paulette Nardal, Alain Locke, W. E. B. Du Bois, George Padmore, and Tiemoko Garan Kouyat�--<i>The Practice of Diaspora</i> takes account of the highly divergent ways of imagining race beyond the barriers of nation and language. In doing so, it reveals the importance of translation, arguing that the politics of diaspora are legible above all in efforts at negotiating difference among populations of African descent throughout the world.</p></p><p>Brent Hayes Edwards is Professor in the Department of English and Comparative Literature at Columbia University.&#x201c;There are any number of quite impressive issues and approaches in Brent Edwards's <i>The Practice of Diaspora</i>. Seemingly familiar, apparently over-played, categories are archivally reworked--or else finely spun out--into webs of instructive relationship. A good and timely work, as much for its particulars on (post-)coloniality and writing "race" as for Edwards's legitime defense of diaspora. The conceptual and socio-historical fluency with which this work re-positions Paris and its noirs is especially welcome. Recall of this sort has been somewhat overdue.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Lemuel A. Johnson, Professor of English at the University of Michigan</b><br><br>&#x201c;This is a magnificent study. <i>The Practice of Diaspora</i>'s contribution to scholarship is made in at least four areas: African-American studies (generally speaking), African-American literary studies, modernism, and literary theory. The combination of its theoretical adeptness, its rigor, and its depth of scholarship is quite remarkable. I don't recall having seen this mixture of theory, textual interpretation, cultural history, intellectual history, and diaspora scholarship before. Edwards's study is quite ambitious but I think he more than delivers on those ambitions. I think its importance does not rest simply in the depth of its scholarship or the mixed mode of its argumentation, but in how much it will encourage others to return to these areas with a rigor that does not depend upon a demonstration of "discursive mastery" in particular areas but upon cross-area attentiveness.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Wahneema Lubiano, Professor of Literature at Duke University</b><br><br>&#x201c;<i>The Practice of Diaspora</i> is nothing short of a masterpiece. By looking at the way black life, thought, struggles and quite literally, words, are translated across the black Francophone and Anglophone worlds, Edwards reveals how Paris became a locus for the development of black modernism and internationalism during the crucial interwar years. Rather than search for some essential unity, he explores difference, creative tensions, misapprehensions and misunderstandings between key black intellectuals. The result is a spectacular interdisciplinary study that will profoundly change the way we think about the African diaspora.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Robin D. G. Kelley, author of <i>Freedom Dreams: The Black Radical Imagination</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;A remarkably precise feat of scholarship which illuminates the exchanges between the Harlem Renaissance and the Negritude movement, achieves a transnational, mapping between Harlem and Paris, the Caribbean and Africa, and suggests a new vision of diasporic modernism.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Michel Fabre, author of <i>From Harlem to Paris</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;<i>The Practice of Diaspora</i> is so deeply rooted in the specifics of history, biography, and astute textual analysis that it amounts to nothing less than a new understanding of that old term "African Diaspora." Because of Brent Edwards' imaginative research, subtle questioning, and acute powers of synthesis, this book succeeds from start to finish. It is beautifully written, consistently entertaining, and compelling as both an argument and a scholarly narrative.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Arnold Rampersad, author of <i>The Art and Imagination of W.E.B.

Any reader interested in the intellectual and political issues represented and discussed by Ren� Maran, Alain Locke, Jessie Fauset, the Nardal sisters, Claude McKay, W. E. B. Du Bois, George Padmore, or Tiemoko Garan Kouyat�, anyone concerned about the semantics of racial terms, the debates in francophone and anglophone journals, about the significance of Nancy Cunard's <i>Negro: An Anthology</i>, or about diasporic writing will find this book indispensable.<i>The Practice of Diaspora</i> makes a major contribution to the much-needed internationalization of American Studies.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Werner Sollors, author of <i>Neither Black Nor White Yet Both</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;An exciting, innovative and extremely important study of black internationalism between the two World Wars of the Twentieth Century.

A vast compendium of writings from all their major works, books, journals, leaflets etc. All the stars are here, and much more. Much of this has been translated into English for the first time.</p><p>Text: English, French (translation)"The accused have never denied the charge of misappropriating the funds of the Strasbourg Student Union. Indeed, they openly admit to having made the union pay nearly 5000 francs for the printing of 10,000 pamphlets, not to mention the cost of other literature inspired by the 'Situationist International.' These publications express aims and ideas which, to put it mildly, have nothing to do with the purpose of a student union. . . . Rejecting all morality and legal restraint, making sweeping denunciations of their fellow students, their professors, God, religion, the clergy, and the governments and political and social systems of the entire world, these cynics do not hesitate to advocate theft, the destruction of scholarship, the abolition of work, total subversion, and a permanent worldwide proletarian revolution with 'unrestrained pleasure' as its only goal." -- <i>Judge Llabador, Strasbourg District Court 1966</i></p><h2>Naked Lunch, 50th Anniversary Edition</h2><p><i>Naked Lunch</i> is one of the most important novels of the twentieth century, a book that redefined not just literature but American culture. An unnerving tale of a narcotics addict unmoored in New York, Tangiers, and ultimately a nightmarish wasteland known as interzone, its formal innovation, formerly taboo subject matter, and tour de force execution have exerted their influence on the work of authors like Thomas Pynchon, J. G. Ballard, and William Gibson; on the relationship of art and obscenity; and on the shape of music, film and media generally. <i>Naked Lunch: The Restored Text</i> includes many editorial corrections on the text, several essays he wrote over the years about the book, and an appendix of 20 percent new material and alternate drafts from the original manuscript, which predates the first published version. For the Burroughs enthusiast and the neophyte, this volume is a valuable and fresh experience of this classic of our culture.</p><p>"He was," as <i>Salon</i>'s Gary Kamyia notes, "20th-century drug culture's Poe, its Artaud, its Baudelaire. He was the prophet of the literature of pure experience, a phenomenologist of dread.... Burroughs had the scary genius to turn the junk wasteland into a parallel universe, one as thoroughly and obsessively rendered as Blake's." <p> Why has this homosexual ex-junkie, whose claim to fame rests entirely on one book--the hallucinogenic ravings of a heroin addict--so seized the collective imagination? Burroughs wrote <i>Naked Lunch</i> in a Tangier, Morocco, hotel room between 1954 and 1957. Allen Ginsberg and his beatnik cronies burst onto the scene, rescued the manuscript from the food-encrusted floor, and introduced some order to the pages. It was published in Paris in 1959 by the notorious Olympia Press and in the U.S. in 1962; the landmark obscenity trial that ensued served to end literary censorship in America. </p><p> Burroughs's literary experiment--the much-touted "cut-up" technique--mirrored the workings of a junkie's brain. But it was junk coupled with vision: Burroughs makes teeming amalgam of allegory, sci-fi, and non-linear narration, all wrapped in a blend of humor--slapstick, Swiftian, slang-infested humor. What is <i>Naked Lunch</i> about? People turn into blobs amidst the sort of evil that R. Crumb, in the decades to come, would inimitably flesh out with his dark and creepy cartoon images. Perhaps the most easily grasped part of <i>Naked Lunch</i> is its America-bashing, replete with slang and vitriol. Read it and see for yourself.</p>WILLIAM S.

It was the deadliest attack on Jews in American history.<br>&nbsp;<br>For most Americans, the massacre at Tree of Life, the synagogue where Bari Weiss became a bat mitzvah, came as a total shock. But anti-Semitism is the oldest hatred, commonplace across the Middle East and on the rise for years in Europe. So that terrible morning in Pittsburgh raised a question Americans can no longer avoid: Could it happen here?<br>&nbsp;<br>This book is Weiss&#x2019;s answer.<br>&nbsp;<br>Like many, Weiss long believed this country could escape the rising tide of anti-Semitism. But now the luckiest Jews in history are beginning to face a three-headed dragon known all too well to Jews of other times and places: the physical fear of violent assault, the moral fear of ideological vilification, and the political fear of resurgent fascism and populism.<br>&nbsp;<br>No longer the exclusive province of the far right, the far left, and assorted religious bigots, anti-Semitism now finds a home in identity politics and the reaction against identity politics, in the renewal of America First isolationism and the rise of one-world socialism, and in the spread of Islamist ideas into unlikely places. A hatred that was, until recently, reliably taboo, anti-Semitism is migrating toward the mainstream, amplified by social media and a culture of conspiracy that threatens us all.<br>&nbsp;<br>Weiss&#x2019;s&nbsp;cri de coeur is an unnerving reminder that Jews must never lose their hard-won instinct for danger, and a powerful case for renewing Jewish and American values in uncertain times from one of our most provocative writers.

I turned on CNN. Nothing yet. I refreshed and refreshed and refreshed Twitter every few seconds. There were posts from some local sources urging people to stay away from the area; warnings that the police had shut down that part of the neighborhood; speculation that the shooter might be on the loose. I thought about the Boston Marathon bombers&#x2014;how one of the Tsarnaev brothers hid in a boat in someone&#x2019;s backyard&#x2014;and told my parents not to leave the house.<br><br> Soon I started getting WhatsApp messages from close friends in Israel, where Shabbat was ending&#x2014;a strange reversal from the years of the Second Intifada when I would write them: Are you safe?<br><br> I checked the news again.

Today, it does the righteous work of rescuing Jews and non-Jews facing persecution all over the world. His final post before he entered the building was: &#x201c;HIAS likes to bring invaders in that kill our people. I can&#x2019;t sit by and watch my people get slaughtered.

More exotic- seeming than her Buddhist grandmother's traditional specialties, the campy, preservative-filled "delicacies" of mainstream America capture her imagination. <br><br> In <i>Stealing Buddha's Dinner</i>, the glossy branded allure of Pringles, Kit Kats, and Toll House Cookies becomes an ingenious metaphor for Nguyen's struggle to become a "real" American, a distinction that brings with it the dream of the perfect school lunch, burgers and Jell- O for dinner, and a visit from the Kool-Aid man. Vivid and viscerally powerful, this remarkable memoir about growing up in the 1980s introduces an original new literary voice and an entirely new spin on the classic assimilation story.</p><p>Winner of the PEN/Jerard AwardBich Minh Nguyen teaches literature and creative writing at Purdue University.

The old man's son is a farmer and needs a new sheepdog to replace Nell, who has grown too old to work, so the old man decides to give his son Floss. Somewhere in her memory Floss knows about sheep and she soon learns how to be a sheepdog. But one day when Floss is on the hillside herding sheep, she sees the children playing with a new ball and can't resist joining in. Meanwhile the sheep escape &#x2014; and the farmer is very angry. Floss is put in the doghouse, while Nell rounds up the sheep. But after this Floss becomes a very good sheepdog &#x2014; although, when she has time, she still likes to play ball with the children.</p><p>Kim Lewis is a Canadian-born artist, printmaker, author and illustrator. Her titles for children include Just Like Floss, Little Baa and Goodnight Harry, the first in a popular series about a cuddly toy elephant. Many of her picture books have been set in Northumberland where she lives with her family.After the old man gives Floss, his Border collie, to his son, she's trained to take over the work of the old sheepdog on the son's farm. Floss does her job well but longs to play ball with the farmer's children--a breach of discipline, the son thinks. But after she proves herself in the dog trials, he relents, even joining in the joyous game. Perhaps not all dog trainers will agree with the farmer's indulgence, but the human message--that play has its place--is a good one, giving the story more substance than Lewis's earlier efforts (Emma's Lamb, 1991); her soft pencil illustrations of the upland sheep country of northern England are beautifully observed, while Floss herself is especially appealing.

Months ago, Kal Wilson&#39;s wife was killed in a plane crash. President Wilson is sure it was no accident-and he wants revenge. He needs Doc Ford to spring him loose from the watchful eye of the Secret Service, keep him alive, then get him home. Ford has just been picked for presidential duty- whether he likes it or not.</p><p>Randy Wayne White is the author of seventeen previous Doc Ford novels and four collections of nonfiction. He lives in an old house built on an Indian mound in Pineland, Florida.Former U.S. President Kal Wilson is dying. He has one more score to settle before he gives in to disease. He coerces retired deep-cover agent Doc Ford into helping him with this final mission. The machismo is all in place, and although Doc Ford is not the personable character he is in the author's other Doc Ford adventures, George Guidall's performance is impeccable. Guidall's pacing in action sequences sets pulses pounding, his character voices are consistent and believable, his women characters (however few) don't simper, and his accents, Middle Eastern and Spanish, are flawless.

Unfortunately, they can't save Melvin Sneedly from getting paddled by his bionic hamster. But, frankly, they wouldn't want to, because besides being the school brainiac, Melvin is also a tattletale.

So when she pays a surprise visit to Chesapeake Shores, Luke is thrilled...at first. A fling with this wild Irish rose is one thing, but forever? Maybe someday, but not when he's totally focused on establishing a business that will prove his mettle to his overachieving family.<br><br>Given Luke's reaction, Moira has some soul-searching of her own to do. Scarred by her father's abandonment, she wonders if Luke, with his playboy past, is truly the family man she longs for. Adding to her dilemma, she's offered an amazing chance at a dream career of her own.<br><br>Deep down, though, Moira knows home is the real prize, and that love can be every bit as enchanted as a summer garden.<br><br></p><p>With her roots firmly planted in the South, Sherryl Woods has written many of her more than 100 books in that distinctive setting, whether in her home state of Virginia, her adopted state, Florida, or her much-adored South Carolina.

She is the New York Times and USA Today bestselling author of over 75 romances for Silhouette Desire and Special Edition.<br><br>Mladdening Moira was still in his head!<br><br>Luke O'Brien had been home from Ireland for a month now. He'd been obsessing over his plans for the pub he wanted to open in Chesapeake Shores, worrying about the likely uproar with his family. He'd gone out a few times with the sophisticated, delectable Kristen Lewis, picking up where they'd left off during a brief rendezvous in Ireland. Truth be told, it was a matter of convenience for both of them, not a meeting of the hearts, but until recently it had been an excellent distraction, if only because it had complications galore that appealed to Luke's desire for a taste of rebellion.<br><br>But then along came Moira Malone with the sharp tongue and wry wit.<br><br>"I'll not be taken in by smooth talk and a wink," she'd told Luke, firmly putting him in his place. "I've been around such men all my life."<br><br>They'd met on the O'Brien family's holiday excursion to Ireland a few months ago. She was the granddaughter of his own grandmother's old flame, Dillon O'Malley. She was beautiful, but impossible. In fact, it was entirely likely that she was the most frustrating female he'd ever had the pleasure of meeting, in part because she'd been mostly immune to his charm. She'd complicated his life in an entirely different way. She'd unexpectedly engaged his heart.<br><br>After staying on in Ireland for several weeks after the rest of the family had returned to Chesapeake Shores, Luke had eventually come home, ready to move on with his life. Ready to finally get serious about life, according to his impatient father, who'd vocally protested the wasting of his college education.<br><br>He had a degree in history, for heaven's sakes! Had anyone seriously thought he'd use that? He certainly hadn't. He'd chosen history because he enjoyed the subject as much as any other and he'd needed to get the college off his back by declaring a major.<br><br>Now, though, the clock was ticking, and the tightly knit O'Briens were all watching and waiting to see what he&#x2014;the youngest of family matriarch Nell's grandchildren&#x2014;planned to make of himself. He doubted that opening an Irish pub on Shore Road was what anyone in the family would have guessed his calling to be.<br><br>Restless after going over his plans for the thousandth time, hoping to be so sure of himself, so confident of his path that no one would even attempt to talk him out of it, he wandered over to his brother's office.<br><br>Matthew was currently proving himself to be almost as talented and innovative an architect as their world-renowned uncle Mick. Like most of Luke's family, Matthew had discovered his passion early on. Luke had envied everyone in his family, not only for knowing what they wanted, but also for succeeding at it, sometimes phenomenally well. He had daunting examples to follow.<br><br>When Luke arrived, Matthew was so absorbed in the blueprints on his desk he never even glanced up, which gave Luke more pacing time to get his thoughts in order. He intended to try out his idea first on the most receptive audience he was likely to find.<br><br>Eventually, Matthew looked up, spotted him and blinked. "How long have you been here?"<br><br>"Long enough," Luke said. "How many towns and villages have you designed today?"<br><br>"Only the one," Matthew replied, grinning. "I think the plans for this community in Florida are just about set to go to the developer for final approval. He's very anxious to break ground, judging by the frequency of his calls for updates on my progress."<br><br>Luke had seen his share of architectural renderings over the years, but he had to admit that he lacked the vision to translate them into brick-and-mortar towns. Still, he peered over his brother's shoulder, prepared to feign the proper enthusiasm. What he saw, though, as he leafed through the pages, left him dumbstruck.<br><br>"You designed this? From scratch? A whole community, from houses to Main Street to schools, a library and even a church? You just looked over a few acres of vacant land and imagined all this?"<br><br>Matthew's grin spread as he nodded. "Pretty awesome, if I do say so myself."<br><br>"I guess all that time you spent playing with Lego as a kid wasn't wasted, after all. Has Uncle Mick seen it?"<br><br>"Of course. He's in here pestering me every other day. I gather when he isn't calling me, the developer's calling Uncle Mick to nudge things along."<br><br>"And?"<br><br>"Uncle Mick says it's as good as anything he's ever done," Matthew said, looking pleased.<br><br>"Which means it's a thousand times better," Luke concluded. "He's not going to say so on your first big job and risk your having a swelled head and demanding a bigger salary."<br><br>Matthew shrugged off the compliment. "Things can always be better. Uncle Mick has even talked to me about things he would have done differently if he had Chesapeake Shores to design over again."<br><br>Luke regarded him with surprise. "Really? Like what?"<br><br>"He admits that Uncle Thomas was right about wanting the community to be built in an environmentally friendly way. He says he wouldn't have given him such a tough time about it."<br><br>Luke laughed. "No, he'd just give him a tough time on general principle, the same as he does with Dad."<br><br>"More than likely," Matthew agreed. "So what brings you by here at the end of the day?"<br><br>"I was hoping you'd have time for a drink."<br><br>"Sure. Mind if Laila tags along? I was going to meet her for dinner in an hour. You can join us."<br><br>"That'll work. There are some things I'd like to run by her, anyway."<br><br>His brother regarded him suspiciously. "Just what do you and my wife have to talk about?"<br><br>"Maybe we're conspiring to throw a surprise party for your birthday," Luke teased, knowing how much his brother abhorred the whole concept of surprise parties, even though he'd determinedly pulled off his own almost-surprise wedding in Ireland, keeping Laila mostly in the dark until his Christmas Eve proposal.<br><br>"My birthday was just a couple of months ago, and neither of you is that much of a long-range planner," Matthew retorted. "Try again."<br><br>"How about I explain it over drinks?" Luke countered.<br><br>"Fine. Brady's okay?"<br><br>"Actually, I have someplace else in mind. I need to stop by Dad's office first. Why don't I meet you on Shore Road in front of Panini Bistro in twenty minutes?"<br><br>"Suits me," Matthew said. "I'll call Laila and let her know. If I get there first, I'll grab a table."<br><br>"Actually, don't do that," Luke said. "Wait for me in front, okay? Tell Laila to grab a table, though, if she gets there before we're back."<br><br>"Back?" Matthew gave him an odd look. "Curiouser and curiouser."<br><br>"Trust me, okay?"<br><br>"Always," Matthew said at once. "See you in a few minutes."<br><br>Luke gave him a wave, then headed for his father's office. He was hoping to find his father gone for the day and perhaps only his sister still there. Susie might give him grief over his request, but she was less likely to pull rank and demand answers.<br><br>Even better, he found the real estate management company run by his father to be closed for the day. Using the key he had for the occasions when he helped out showing properties, he went in, plucked a key off the board for the properties they owned or managed and closed back up.<br><br>He beat Matthew to their appointed meeting spot by mere seconds.<br><br>"Where to now, o secretive one?" Matthew inquired.<br><br>"Not far," Luke said, heading down the block to a large empty space that had been occupied by a French restaurant that had gone belly-up, unable to survive during the slower winter months. Personally, he thought it had failed because of the god-awful uncomfortable chairs that had made the customers squirm through the torturous minutes it took to eat their overpriced food, but what did he know?<br><br>He led the way inside and flipped on lights, then turned to his older brother. "What do you think?"<br><br>Matthew looked blank. "Of what? It's an empty space."<br><br>Luke held his gaze. "Think you could help me turn it into a warm and welcoming Irish pub?"<br><br>The words were no sooner out of his mouth than he heard a hoot from the doorway and turned to see his uncle Mick standing there.<br><br>"I come to check on why lights are blazing in an empty property and find you making plans to open a pub?" Mick said, his expression incredulous.<br><br>Luke sighed. He hadn't wanted such a tough audience right from the outset, but maybe it was for the best. Mick had a good business head and a real understanding of what this town needed. He wondered if Mick would see the value of a gathering spot in the heart of town, a warm and welcoming place in the Irish tradition.<br><br>"That's what I'm thinking," Luke confirmed, looking Mick directly in the eye. "What's your opinion?"<br><br>Mick's gaze narrowed. "What makes you think you can do this? You never worked as a bartender, as far as I know. Never worked in a restaurant, either."<br><br>"Not entirely true," Luke said. "When I stayed on in Ireland, I worked for a time at McDonough's, the pub where we spent so much time while we were there. I also traveled all over the country visiting every pub I could find, from those in cities to those in small villages. I asked a million questions, took copious notes and cooked my share of fish 'n' chips. I even bought an antique bar in a place that was closing. It's being shipped over here for arrival in a month's time."<br><br>Matthew's expression was now as stunned as his uncle's. "I thought you stayed in Ireland after the family and Kristen left because you developed some misguided crush on the impossible Moira."<br><br>"That's what I wanted everyone to think," he admitted, and it had been partly true. "I wasn't ready to have all of you shoot down this idea of mine. I was still formulating it, testing it out in my heart and my head to see if it felt right." He leveled a look into his brother's eyes, pleading with him to understand and back him in this. "It does."<br><br>"But a pub?" Matthew said, his concern evident.<br><br>"Why?"<br><br>"In a weird way, it was something Mack said a while back," Luke explained, referring to his sister Susie's husband. "I was giving him some advice and he made an offhand comment that maybe I should consider being a shrink like Will. He was actually being sarcastic, but the idea stuck."<br><br>"And that led you to this pub idea?" Mick said. "What kind of sense does that make?"<br><br>"Everyone knows people pour out their troubles to bartenders," Luke explained. "I like listening, not in any official capacity, the way Will does, but just being a sounding board. When we were in Ireland, I saw that kind of thing happening in every pub we went to, and it all kind of fell into place. Pubs create their own kind of community, not just for drinking but for food and friendship, for music and laughter. At least when they're done right. I'd like to be at the center of something like that."<br><br>"Well, I'll be," Matthew said.<br><br>Luke studied his brother's face to see if shock was edging toward approval. "So, do you think I'm insane?" he prodded.<br><br>"A little," Matthew said. "But I can also see it working. How about you, Uncle Mick? Look around. Imagine that antique bar across the back wall with a big mirror that will bring in the view of the bay, at least during the day. Maybe not as dark as the usual Irish pub, but one suited to a seaside town. Laila and I saw one like that in Howth with a view of the marina."<br><br>He glanced toward Luke. "You mentioned music. Does that mean you'd like a small area for a band?"<br><br>"Absolutely," Luke confirmed. "Nothing too large or fancy, just an area where musicians can set up. I'm hoping to book some authentic Irish groups from time to time. Bands, singers, whatever I can find."<br><br>"Got it," Matthew said, jotting notes on the pad that was ever-present in his pocket.

It documents that the same doctrine was faithfully transmitted to their descendants in the first few centuries. It also describes where, when, and by whom, the doctrines began to change. The ancient church fathers make it very easy to know for sure what the complete teachings of Jesus and the twelve apostles were. You will learn, from their own writings, what the first century disciples taught about the various doctrines that divide our church today. You will learn what was discussed at the Seven General Councils and why. You will learn about the cults and cult leaders who began to change doctrine and spread their heresy. And you will learn how those heresies became the standard teaching in the medieval church.

Cats may indeed be capable of great mindfulness, but we are thinking beings too. In my own case, unfortunately, a being who thinks rather too much." In the latest installment of the Dalai Lama&#x2019;s Cat series, His Holiness&#x2019;s Cat ("HHC") is on a mission: to think less, to experience more, to live in the moment. She soon learns the proper phrase for this, being mindful, or, a concept better known to her as the power of meow. What ensues is a journey to discover her own true nature, to gain a deeper understanding of her mind, and to experience life&#x2019;s greatest joy, the here and now. Throughout, there are encounters with familiar inhabitants of Dharamsala, as well as a whole new cast of characters: a senior exec from one of Silicon Valley&#x2019;s most famous social media companies (hint: the name rhymes with "litter"), the Pope&#x2019;s beloved dog (who shares a shockingly similar title: HHD, His Holiness&#x2019;s Dog), and a public health inspector who threatens to have our poor narrator banned from the Himalaya Book Caf�. In this follow-up to the Dalai Lama&#x2019;s Cat and the Art of Purring, readers escape to the enchanting and exotic world of the Dalai Lama&#x2019;s monastery in the Himalayas, and take a peek inside the mind of a delightfully imperfect creature on the path to enlightenment. By accompanying HHC on her journey, you will learn new ways to relate to your own mind: slowing down, finding peace, and abiding in the boundless radiance and benevolence that is your own true nature.</p><p>David Michie is the best-selling author of The Dalai Lama&#x2019;s Cat, Buddhism for Busy People, and Hurry Up and Meditate.

That statement could be a guiding light for the <em>Odd</em> series, and perhaps even your work in general of late. Was allowing the laughs to join the darkness a conscious decision?</p> <p><strong>DEAN: </strong>Humor began to enter my work as far back as <em>Watchers</em> (1987), and by <em>Lightning</em> (1988), my agent and publisher at that time became alarmed and counseled me that suspense and humor never mix. They were not able to offer a cogent explanation of why the two never mix. One of my favorite films of all time is "North by Northwest," which is tense and funny; so I just kept doing what I was doing. By the time I moved to Bantam Books with <em>Fear Nothing</em> (1998), humor became the binding glue in all of my books except for <em>The Taking</em>, <em>Velocity</em>, <em>The Husband</em>, and <em>Your Heart Belongs to Me</em>.</p> <p>Odd Thomas is speaking for me when he says, "Humanity is a parade of fools, and I'm right up front with a baton." Odd is a spiritual guy, and in my experience, genuinely spiritual people--as opposed to those for whom faith is either a crutch or a bludgeon--have a great sense of humor. They recognize that our fallen world is not just tragic but also absurd, often hilariously absurd, and that laughing at humanity's hubris and reckless transgressive behavior is a potent way to deny legitimacy to that hubris. Besides, if a character is able to make you laugh out loud, a bond is formed that ensures you will worry more for him when he finds himself in jeopardy. And I will always remember that it wasn't my looks or my sartorial splendor or macho toughness--ha!--that won Gerda; she says that she laughed so much on our first date, her stomach hurt the next day. That was better than being told, as I expected, that her stomach hurt because, after I took her home, she spent the night throwing up.</p> <p><strong>MICHAEL: </strong>A three-part short novel titled <em>Odd Interlude</em> was released in ebook-only form this summer. Tell us a little about the way this was conceived and written. Did you have that planned before the new novel or did it come to you later in Odd's journey?</p> <p><strong>DEAN: </strong>I had written a 32,000-word ebook novella, <em>The Moonlit Mind</em>, to intrigue readers about a forthcoming novel, <em>77 Shadow Street</em>. The novella sold very well and drew strong reader response. In fact, I'm pretty sure a lot of people liked <em>Moonlit</em> better than <em>77 Shadow Street</em>! So as I was finishing <em>Odd Apocalypse</em>, my publisher asked me to write a 60,000- to 70,000-word short novel in three parts to reintroduce readers to Odd. It was outside the seven-book arc of the series, and I had great fun with it. By the way, those readers who don't do ebooks tend to get exercised about a piece appearing only digitally. In order to avoid being whacked by an irate reader while waiting at the counter for my Big Mac, I am happy to tell you that <em>Odd Interlude</em> will be published in paperback within a few months.</p> <p><strong> MICHAEL: </strong>Rumor has it a movie of Odd Thomas is on the way, and that you're pleased with it, which is anything but the rule when it comes to adaptations. What can you tell us about the film version and why you are so pleased with Stephen Sommers' take?</p> <p><strong>DEAN: </strong>I have a glowing review of the film at deankoontz.com and on my official Facebook page. Anton Yelchin and Addison Timlim give wonderfully nuanced and affecting performances. Steve's sense of pace and his writing are even better than his previous best, and his scene transitions are amazing, something really new and highly effective. The picture drops much from the book, but at the same time it's absolutely true to the book, to its characters and its themes.</p> <p>Steve is also a great guy and a family man. When he'd send me long emails about progress on the picture, he'd write also about his daughters and family things. After one such email, I wrote him back to say that he was so normal, compared to most of my Hollywood experiences, that I was getting suspicious. I said I was steeling myself to wake up one morning and discover that he'd been arrested with Charlie Sheen, crossing the border from Mexico in a school bus loaded with drugs and explosives. <br></p> <p>(continued)</p> <p>&gt;Read the full interview<br>&gt;See all of Michael Koryta's books</p> <p><br></p><b>Dean Koontz,</b> the author of many #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers, lives in Southern California with his wife, Gerda, their golden retriever, Elsa, and the enduring spirit of their goldens, Trixie and Anna.</p><h2>Heirs and Graces (A Royal Spyness Mystery)</h2><p><b>Lady Georgiana Rannoch learns that not everyone knows their table manners when a knife ends up in a duke&#x2019;s back in the seventh Royal Spyness Mystery.<br></b><br><i>London, 1934.</i> Entrusted by Her Majesty the Queen with grooming Jack Altringham&#x2014;the Duke of Eynsford&#x2019;s newly discovered heir fresh from the Outback of Australia&#x2014;for high society, Georgie now has the luxurious opportunity to live in one of England&#x2019;s most gorgeous stately homes.

In 1983, he won first prize in a children's book competition and since then has worked exclusively as an author and illustrator of children's books, which have won awards in Sweden and Germany.

All the while, prosperity preachers exploit the poor and the needy to stockpile their riches. What can followers of the true gospel do to combat the deception?</p><p>Through a remarkable and fascinating journey, Costi Hinn went from a next-generation prosperity preacher to the first to abandon the family faith and share the true gospel. Nephew of the world-famous televangelist, Benny Hinn, Costi had a front-row seat to the inner workings and theology of the prosperity gospel. But as Costi's faith deepened, so did his questions about prosperity teaching. As the deceptions in his past were exposed, Costi came face to face with the hypocrisy and devastation caused by his belief system, and the overwhelming truth about the real Jesus Christ.</p><p>This captivating look into the daily lives of one of the world's leading prosperity dynasties offers a thoughtful perspective on the perils of greed, the power of the true gospel, and hope for the future of the global church. Through real-life stories, Costi challenges and equips readers to be living lights pointing the way to the true gospel and the saving grace of Christ. <em>God, Greed, and the (Prosperity) Gospel </em>will bolster your faith and encourage your own journey toward the Truth.</p></p><p><p>COSTI W.

Costi and his wife have three young children.</p>Hinn (Defining Deception), the nephew of Israeli Christian televangelist Benny Hinn, rails in this convincing, vociferous work against the 'health and wealth' theology of prosperity gospel preachers as anti-Christian, exploitative, and abusive. Part memoir, part critique of prosperity gospel theology, Hinn's candid work delves into his childhood and young adulthood within the family's ministry. He then explores his first inklings of doubt at Dallas Baptist University and his subsequent rejection of his role as 'the next great anointed healer' when he is forced to choose between his family and his fiancand eacute;e, who feels she must hide her asthma because Hinn's family made her feel as if 'sickness is not allowed in [his] home.' Hinn rebuilds his spiritual life and ministry within a more mainstream, conservative evangelical faith and, in the book's final chapters, offers a theological critique of prosperity gospel practices, suggestions for a moderated understanding of God's role in human well-being, and thoughts on how to reach out to family and friends who believe the prosperity gospel message. Hinn's testimony will be most meaningful to Christians who have grown up in but are skeptical of the prosperity tradition.

He wrote evocatively about the beauty and pleasure in cooking by focusing on preparing simple foods well. This new edition of his classic cookbook includes a fresh cover, new interior design, and a foreword by Mark Bittman&#x2014;so that a whole new generation of food lovers can enjoy this inspiring book. Olney&#x2019;s 175 recipes are so straightforward that cooks will be inspired to go right into the kitchen: herb omelets, fish with zucchini, lamb shanks with garlic, and many more. He also shares techniques (several featuring his own illustrations), such as fermenting vinegar, in line with the back-to-basics trend in cooking. Olney&#x2019;s emphasis on simplicity and improvisation in cooking will resonate with today&#x2019;s cooks and food lovers.</p><p>Richard Olney, best known as a general food writer, is one of America's most erudite experts on authentic French cooking, but it's difficult to find anyone who knows much about him, except for such authorities as Patricia Wells and the late James Beard. The reprinting of Olney's classic and indispensable <i>Simple French Food</i> offers readers the chance to learn more about this most idiosyncratic and accomplished of cooks. No pared down, paint-by-numbers recipes here: Olney is obsessed not only with showing you how to cook, but how to see, smell, feel, listen, and taste as well. Read, for example, Olney's description of Scrambled Eggs and you will understand what you are missing when they are not properly prepared (as they almost never are): "correctly prepared, the softest of barely perceptible curds held in a thickly liquid, smooth, creamy suspension." To scramble eggs, Olney insists on a wooden spoon, a generously buttered copper pan or bain-marie, and a precise control of the temperature--very simple to accomplish, as all his recipes are, as long as you take care to absorb fully his sensuous and exact instructions. <i>--Sumi Hahn Almquist</i>LTD Net Sales for 1992 edition from 1994 (does not include LTD for previous edition).</p><h2>Love Alone Is Credible</h2><p><p>In Hans Urs von Balthasar&#x2019;s masterwork,&nbsp;<i>The Glory of the Lord,</i>&nbsp;the great theologian used the term "theological aesthetic" to describe what he believed to the most accurate method of interpreting the concept of divine love, as opposed to approaches founded on historical or scientific grounds.

Drawing on evolution, neuroscience, and decades of clinical experience, Dr. Breggin analyzes what he calls our negative legacy emotions-the painful emotional heritage that encumbers all human beings. The author marshals evidence that we evolved as the most violent and yet most empathic creatures on Earth. Evolution dealt with this species-threatening conflict between our violence and our close-knit social life by building guilt, shame, and anxiety into our genes. These inhibiting emotions were needed prehistorically to control our self-assertiveness and aggression within intimate family and clan relationships. Dr. Breggin shows how guilt, shame, and anxiety eventually became self-defeating and demoralizing legacies from our primitive past that no longer play any useful or positive role in mature adult life. He then guides the reader through the Three Steps to Emotional Freedom, starting with how to identify negative legacy emotions and then how to reject their control over us. Finally, he describes how to triumph over and transcend guilt, shame, and anxiety on the way to greater emotional freedom and a more rational, loving, and productive life.</p><p><b>Peter R. Breggin, MD</b>, has for many decades led successful efforts to reform the mental health field and to promote empathic therapies. His scientific work has provided the foundation for modern criticism of psychiatric drugs and diagnoses.

Instead it is a work of history, with King at its focal point. The tumultuous years that Branch covers saw the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, the beginnings of American disillusionment with the war in Vietnam, and, of course, the civil rights movement that King led, a movement that transformed America as the nation finally tried to live up to the ideals on which it was founded. <p> <strong>Timeline of a Trilogy</strong> </p><p>Taylor Branch's America in the King Years series is both a biography of Martin Luther King and a history of his age.

Beginning in Alaska and ending two months later in Argentina, the peregrine falcon&#x2019;s annual migration is an 8,000-mile flight across the Americas. This beautifully illustrated book allows young readers to follow one bird on its journey. Based on the actual migration of a real bird that was tracked by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the book is filled with amazing facts about the bird&#x2019;s diet, habits, and navigational abilities, as well as stunning views of the many habitats the peregrine visits along the way.</p><p>Madeleine Dunphy is an educational consultant who teaches children about endangered environments.

The author begins the book by describing the events in September that signal to the peregrine that it is time to migrate. When the bird begins her migration, she tells how she uses instinct and her excellent eyesight to identify mountains and rivers that guide her on her way south. The migration requires a lot of energy and exposes the peregrine to numerous dangers. The author tells how the peregrine eats pigeons, doves and other prey and how she bathes herself after eating a messy meal. Since migration is tiring, the peregirine stops on the Texas coast to rest and to build up a reserve of energy for her long flight over the Gulf of Mexico. During her first night over the water, she perches on a ship's mast to rest. A few days later, she flies over Guatemala and then Panama. Along the way, she joins other peregrines on their way south and a flock of Swainson's and broad-winged hawks flying the same route. From Panama, she flies over the ocean to Colombia and then on to Brazil. As she nears the end of her journey, she begins to fly fewer miles each day. One night in Bolivia, she is lucky and does not wind up being dinner for a great horned owl. Finally, the falcon arrives in Argentina; where she will stay until next March, when she migrates back to Alaska. This well-illustrated, well-written book provides a wealth of information about peregrine falcons, bird migration, and predator-prey relationships. It would be an excellent addition to a school library or to a child's personal library. I recommend THE PEREGRINE'S JOURNEY highly.<br>&#x2014;James W.

It was written in the ancient Paleo-Hebrew language.<br><br> Moses was told by God to have Aaron, the high priest, pray it over the children of Israel every day. By doing this, God&nbsp;would place His name (His very person, His holy character, His power and authority) supernaturally upon them.&nbsp;For forty years, as the children of Israel wandered in the wilderness, they received supernatural provision, divine health,&nbsp;angelic protection. And they even prospered&#x2013;even their clothes and shoes never wore out (Deut. 29:5).<br><br> Through intense study of the original Hebrew text, Warren M. Marcus has unearthed a far deeper and profound meaning of&nbsp;this divine prayer than we presently have in our Bibles.

After I finished reading this book I was compelled to kneel, pray, worship, and take time to apply what I had read and received, thanking God for His blessing and kindness.

In his book, <i>The Priestly Prayer of the Blessing</i>, Warren shares how this dream was the catalyst that began his fascinating journey to find and truly know God in a supernatural, experiential, and intimate way! Ultimately, his book conveys how we can truly access our heavenly Father in a tangible, powerful way! This book unveils the deeper meaning of the prayer that the high priest Aaron would pronounce over the children of Israel every day while they wandered in the wilderness. Warren was given a revelation of the fullness of the meaning of this prayer as expressed in the Hebrew. His findings will fascinate you and profoundly affect you as you sense the heavenly Father&#x2019;s love for you and as you access the Father&#x2019;s divine embrace!&nbsp;Many books have been written on the &#x201c;Father Heart&#x201d; of God, but this book by Warren Marcus is not just knowing about our heavenly Father and His character, but instead it&#x2019;s about Warren&#x2019;s discovery on how to actually access our heavenly Father in a supernatural, experiential, and intimate way.&nbsp;I highly recommend reading this powerful and engaging book.&nbsp;<br> &#x2013;Joseph Farah<br> Founder and Chief Executive Officer, WND.com, WND Books, WND Films<br><br> I have personally been blessed by proclaiming this Priestly Prayer of the Blessing over myself, and family every day.

I speak the verses out of God&#x2019;s Holy Word and then speak the amplified Hebrew-to-English translation.

I was laid off from a great paying job and needed work, and God has blessed me with two different jobs. In praying this divine prayer over my life daily it has made me capable to stand firmly in boldness and proclaim &#x201c;His sweet name,&#x201d; and have the courage to speak out and not be in fear of making a mistake or saying the wrong thing. I have always been a shy person, but God has enabled me to be bold!<br> &#x2014;Sharon K Barr<br><br> Your heart will be stirred and your faith inspired, just as mine was, when you read the unfolding of the precious revelation that G-D has given Warren. It was my joy to be there when Warren Marcus first met His Messiah in October 1974. Hallelujah.<br> &#x2014;Pastor James Tate<br> Pastor Emeritus of Calvary Tabernacle<br><br> The revelation of the Priestly Prayer of the Blessing that the God of Israel has imparted to Warren Marcus has made a profound impact on my life. I believe this revelation is a prophetic release of the power of embracing the fullness of Elohim and the understanding that the one true God is the God of Israel. Those who worship Him and receive the blessing bear His name. This name is obvious to the entire spirit realm and is the anointing of walking in His favor and His authority. Not only is &#x201c;Abba, Father God,&#x201d; more fully understood, the glory of Yeshua, our great High Priest, is also revealed because He has made those who believe in Him priests forever after the order of Melchizedek. This gives us the blessing of receiving this prayer from Him and also the authority to pray it ourselves over others as His priesthood. As we fully receive, embrace, and then impart this divine prayer in the amplified Hebrew-to-English translation, we proclaim the glory of Elohim (one true G-D of Israel).<br> &#x2014;Cathy Hargett<br> Founder of Highway to Zion Ministries<br><br> There were people who were coming against our reputation and spreading false things about us, but after proclaiming the Priestly Prayer this stopped.

And last of all, we were struggling with our finances, but after proclaiming the divine prayer every day, we now have to turn bookings away because we can&#x2019;t keep up with all of them.<br> &#x2014;The Chrisangis Brothers (Brian and Shawn)<br> Christian Recording Artists<br><br> Faced with losing my home, I began proclaiming the Priestly Prayer of the Blessing every day.

As always, Parker's sparse prose and dialogue are best when spoken, and James Naughton delivers the staccato one-liners with ease. His voice is deep and raspy, and while he doesn't differentiate too much between characters, his rhythmic cadence allows the story to flow naturally and fits Parker's narrative voice well. Naughton is businesslike, never straying into caricature. He gives the reading an Everyman quality that keeps the listener firmly in the moment. A.Z.W. � AudioFile 2008, Portland, Maine-- <i>Copyright � AudioFile, Portland, Maine</i></p><h2>Forage, Harvest, Feast: A Wild-Inspired Cuisine</h2><p><b>One intrepid cook's exploration of her urban terrain</b><br> In this groundbreaking collection of 510 wild food recipes, celebrated New York City forager, cook, kitchen gardener, and writer Marie Viljoen incorporates wild ingredients into everyday and special occasion fare. Motivated by a hunger for new flavors and working with thirty-six versatile wild plants&#x2015;some increasingly found in farmers markets&#x2015;she offers deliciously compelling recipes for everything from cocktails and snacks to appetizers, entr�es, and desserts, as well as bakes, breads, preserves, sauces, syrups, ferments, spices, and salts.<br> From underexplored native flavors like bayberry and spicebush to accessible ecological threats like Japanese knotweed and mugwort, Viljoen presents hundreds of recipes unprecedented in scope. They range from simple quickweed griddle cakes with American burnweed butter to sophisticated dishes like a souffl�ed tomato roulade stuffed with garlic mustard, or scallops seared with sweet white clover, cattail pollen, and sweetfern butter. Viljoen makes unfamiliar ingredients familiar by treating each to a thorough culinary examination, allowing readers to grasp every plant's character and inflection.<br> <i>Forage, Harvest, Feast</i>&#x2015;featuring hundreds of color photographs as well as cultivation tips for plants easily grown at home&#x2015;is destined to become a standard reference for any cook wanting to transform wildcrafted ingredients into exceptional dishes, spices, and drinks.<br> Eating wild food, Viljoen reminds us, is a radical act of remembering and honoring our shared heritage. Led by a quest for exceptional flavor and ecologically sound harvesting, she tames the feral kitchen, making it recognizable and welcoming to regular cooks.</p><p><p>Marie Viljoen is a writer, forager, gardener, and cook, and has loved edible plants since her childhood in South Africa. The author of&nbsp;<em>66 Square Feet</em>, her urban and edible gardens have been profiled by <em>The New York Times</em> and <em>Martha Stewart Living</em> and appear in several books. She is the resident forage expert for<em> Edible Brooklyn </em>and<em> Edible Manhattan</em>&nbsp;magazines and a contributor to Gardenista. Her stories and photographs appear in&nbsp;<em>Saveur</em>,<em> Better Homes and Gardens</em>, and many other publications. Marie leads sought-after seasonal wild plant walks in New York City, where she lives in Brooklyn with her husband, Vincent Mounier.

Viljoen is a writer and wild foods evangelist who packs nearly five hundred recipes for thirty-six wild plants into her well-illustrated, playfully written book.&nbsp;</p> <p>The emphasis is on plants that can be sustainably harvested or which have potential for commercial growing, such as lamb&#x2019;s quarters, serviceberries, and nettles. Gardeners will be doubly delighted to learn how to transform traditional weeds and invasive plants into tempting dishes. How soul-satisfying to turn the chore of weeding out destructive garlic mustard and pesky purslane into harvesting for pesto or a refreshing gazpacho.</p> <p>While the author stresses that her cookbook should be supplemented by field guides and other plant identification resources, she does include information about when plants are ready to harvest, botanical history and lore, and pointers for home and small-scale cultivation. An important bonus are the frequent descriptions of the amount of labor involved in harvest or preparation of recipes; most recipes are simple enough for novice cooks, but it is helpful to know up front when their preparation will require lengthier or trickier cooking or abundant amounts of elbow grease.</p> <p>Extensive chapter and recipe introductions are well researched and fun to read. The author relates her own experiences and experiments, invoking many a humorous phrase along the way, as when she wisely advises cooks to carefully pit stone fruit 'if you are worried about tooth lawsuits' and rhapsodizes about a Cucumber and Green Prickly Ash Salad that is 'a smooth, crisp, sweet-and-sour flavor bomb.'</p> <p>Recipes range from classics like Elderberry Syrup to boldly flavored concoctions like Bayberry Back Ribs and Pokeweed with Anchovy Butter. A smattering of sophisticated cocktails round things out, including Black Ice (fir vodka, black chokeberry syrup, and vermouth) and milkweed-based cocktails like Migration and The Monarch.</p> <p><em>Forage, Harvest, Feast&nbsp;</em>would be a great addition to the shelves of any outdoors enthusiast, small farmer, gardener, or adventurous cook."&nbsp;</p><br><br><p>&#x201c;Marie Viljoen is the real deal. In the heart of New York City, she takes her passion for food and the natural world and makes something extraordinary happen. In her hands a basket of weeds and berries becomes the centerpiece of a delicate, refined, and elegant lunch or a refreshing aperitif. Her curiosity about wild plants and foraging has taken her around the world, but in this book she proves that she&#x2015;and her readers&#x2015;can find both sustenance and delight just around the corner. <em>Forage, Harvest, Feast </em>is a joy to read, an inspiration, and a culinary adventure.&#x201d;<strong>&#x2015;Amy Stewart, author of <em>New York Times </em>bestseller <em>Wicked Plants </em>and <em>The Drunken Botanist</em></strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;Marie approaches her work with a rare combination of gifts&#x2015;a deep knowledge of botany, the adventurous spirit of a forager, and most importantly for her readers, a keen appreciation of how to fill your life with good friends and delicious, locally sourced food.&#x201d;<strong>&#x2015;Stephen Orr, editor in chief of <em>Better Homes and Gardens</em>; author of <em>The New American Herbal</em></strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;Marie has highlighted plants with unique and superb flavors, with straight-talk instructions for how to realize their culinary potential. For the widely&nbsp;occurring&nbsp;and well-known wild edibles, she has uncommonly good recipes. But Viljoen also digs up some more obscure foraged treasures, revealing gustatory possibilities that have remained underexplored and largely unappreciated. She does this with a vigilant eye for the common sense and sustainability that make foraged food a viable feature of the best kitchens.&#x201d;<strong>&#x2015;Samuel Thayer, author of <em>The Forager&#x2019;s Harvest </em>and <em>Incredible Wild Edibles</em></strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;<em>Forage, Harvest, Feas</em><em>t</em> takes wild edibles to their rightful place in the heart of every flavorful&nbsp;kitchen. Marie&#x2019;s passion for unlocking the deliciousness of nature and, at the same time, treading lightly on the earth fills every chapter of this lovely and timeless cookbook.&#x201d;<strong>&#x2015;Tama Matsuoka Wong, coauthor of&nbsp;<em>Foraged Flavor</em></strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;Wild plants are one of the most natural things to eat. It&#x2019;s how we should live. Marie&#x2019;s book shows people how cooking plants from the wild is as easy and fundamental as learning your ABCs.&#x201d;<strong>&#x2015;Mads Refslund, cofounder of Noma; coauthor of&nbsp;<em>Scraps, Wilt and Weeds</em></strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;This book represents by far the most impressive culinary exploration of wild edibles in the Northeast, though it is truly not limited to that region. The recipes can be easily adapted to similar plants in your area. The photos are beautiful, and most of the recipes are simple enough that you don&#x2019;t need a culinary degree to follow them, but at the same time they ooze creativity. Marie even invites you to create liqueurs, pickles, sauces, and countless condiments. It&#x2019;s not just a book of recipes, it&#x2019;s a celebration of local flavors. You can feel the love on every page. There are no other books like it&#x2015;an amazing source of inspiration and a must-have for anyone remotely interested in wild edibles.&#x201d;<strong>&#x2015;Pascal Baudar, author of <em>The New Wildcrafted Cuisine</em> and <em>The Wildcrafting Brewer</em></strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;I <em>love</em> this book!&nbsp;Marie Viljoen&#x2019;s passion for the last remnants of wild foods around us is a call to action. Reconsider the scraggly shrubs, weeds, and trash plants under threat from overzealous landscapers and urban planners. Foraging the wilds connects us to a forgotten and misunderstood piece of human history that&#x2019;s still here today, and it speaks to the resilience of ordinary folks who look around and see plenty when the dullards see weeds. We are weeds. Arise!&#x201d;<strong>&#x2015;Richard McCarthy, executive director of Slow Food USA</strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;In her excellent cookbook&#x2015;and &#x2018;this is a cookbook . . . not a field guide,&#x2019; she implores&#x2015;author Marie Viljoen reminds us that unless we live in a vacuum, we are all surrounded by wild food. Until now there has been a dearth of creative resources to help foragers cook what they find in the wild. Rich with both novel and traditional approaches to culinary recipes, Viljoen also takes us on an enlightening journey that includes cocktails, cordials, and other curiosities that strike me as, well, wildly creative. A well-researched and thoughtful book that conjures Thoreau and Gibbons but with a decisively urban spin. A wide-eyed joy to read.&#x201d;<strong>&#x2015;Evan Mallett, author of <em>The Black Trumpet</em></strong></p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br><br><p>&#x201c;Whether you&#x2019;re a novice or experienced forager, gardener, or cook, this book will open your eyes&#x2015;and taste buds&#x2015;to the wonders of wild plants. With Marie Viljoen&#x2019;s masterful and friendly guidance, you&#x2019;ll not only make enticing, flavorful recipes, but you&#x2019;ll also cultivate a deeper relationship with the world around you. A truly lovely and substantial book.&#x201d;<strong>&#x2015;Emily Han, author of <em>Wild Drinks and Cocktails</em></strong></p></p><h2>Human Growth and Development Across the Lifespan: Applications for Counselors</h2><p><b>A practically focused guide to effective counseling of all clients</b> <p><i>Human Development Across the Life Span</i> is a practical guide to human growth and development, moving beyond theory to include real-world applications for counselors who work with clients.

He conquered the entire Persian Empire, defeating King Darius III four times. He invaded India, defeating a seven-foot-tall Indian king and extending the boundaries of his empire into most of Asia. Brutal in his drive for power, Alexander maintained supremacy by forcing his soldiers to marry the foreigners that they conquered. He amassed a huge fortune by plundering the riches of his enemies and married two foreign princesses, one of them King Darius III's daughter. By the time of his death at age thirty-two, Alexander had conquered most of the known ancient Greek world, a remarkable achievement in only twelve years.<br><br>Demi's storytelling skills bring Alexander the Great's exploits to life. Her splendid illustrations were painted with Chinese inks and gold overlays and with frames inspired by jewels from the tomb of Philip II of Macedonia at Verghina.

Framed scenes include Alexander as an infant with his parents, Queen Oympias and King Philip II; his tutoring by Aristotle; and his many battles across Persia, Asia Minor, and beyond. The text focuses on the facts and general time line of Alexander's life. There is not a lot of elaboration, but no matter. Students wishing for more depth or a different slant may be interested in Peter Chrisp's Alexander the Great: Legend of a Warrior King (DK, 2000) or Vicky Shecter's Alexander the Great Rocks the World (Darby Creek, 2006).

So when Emily's dashing husband died on safari soon after their wedding, she felt little grief. After all, she barely knew him. Now, nearly two years later, she discovers that Philip was a far different man from the one she had married so cavalierly. His journals reveal him to have been a gentleman scholar and antiquities collector who, to her surprise, was deeply in love with his wife. Emily becomes fascinated with this new image of her dead husband and she immerses herself in all things ancient and begins to study Greek.</p> <p>Emily's intellectual pursuits and her desire to learn more about Philip take her to the quiet corridors of the British Museum, one of her husband's favorite places. There, amid priceless ancient statues, she uncovers a dark, dangerous secret involving stolen artifacts from the Greco-Roman galleries. And to complicate matters, she's juggling two very prominent and wealthy suitors, one of whose intentions may go beyond the marrying kind. As she sets out to solve the crime, her search leads to more surprises about Philip and causes her to question the role in Victorian society to which she, as a woman, is relegated.</p></p><p>The daughter of two philosophy professors, I grew up surrounded by books. I was convinced from an early age that I was born in the wrong century and spent much of my childhood under the dining room table pretending it was a covered wagon. Even there, I was never without a book in hand and loved reading and history more than anything. I studied English Literature and Medieval History at the University of Notre Dame. Writing is a natural offshoot of reading, and my first novel,&nbsp;<i>And Only to Deceive</i>, was published in 2005. I'm the author of the long-running Lady Emily Series as well as the novel&nbsp;<i>Elizabeth: The Golden Age</i>. One of the best parts of being an author is seeing your books translated, and I'm currently in love with the Japanese editions of the Emily books.&nbsp;<br><br><br>I played nomad for a long time, living in Indiana, Amsterdam, London, Wyoming, Vermont, Connecticut, and Tennessee before settling down. My husband, the brilliant British novelist&nbsp;Andrew Grant&nbsp;(I may be biased but that doesn't mean I'm wrong) and I now divide our time between Chicago and Wyoming. He makes sure I get my English characters right, and I make sure his American ones sound American.In this charming late Victorian romantic suspense novel, Emily, a young and beautiful widow, regrets her husband's African hunting expedition death less than is proper. The late Philip, Viscount Ashton, had a passion for classical antiquity, and Emily, in an attempt to get to know her husband postmortem, uses her newfound independence in London to study it. In the process, she forms a friendship with Cecile du Lac, a Parisian of a certain age, and realizes that there was more to Philip than she realized&#x2014;including his genuine passion and love for her. The charming Colin Hargreaves may have been involved with Philip in art forgeries, and Andrew Palmer proposes to Emily and then offers evidence that Philip is still alive. By this time, Emily and Cecile are a well-practiced team of amateur sleuths: Phillip's secrets begin to emerge, and travel to Greece provides the possibilities of a new life. Alexander makes Emily light but sympathetic, and conveys period flavor without being ponderous. Her knowledge of the ethical dilemmas posed by Victorian etiquette is considerable; sexual chemistry in particular is handled with exquisite delicacy. The archeological background will lure readers who like to dig for their clues. <i>(Oct.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

It was the most advanced machine ever flown and was finally returning to Earth after three long years in orbit.</p><p>A large storm brewing over the Pacific had caused the NSA to move the reentry up by a full week, but, other than that, everything had gone according to plan.</p><p>Watching the reentry live, Gowdy stared at the huge, high-definition screens that made up the front wall of the room. One showed a column of numbers and symbols that honestly meant nothing to him, except that all of them remained green.</p><p>A second display showed a chart with a line that dove sharply from the upper-left-hand corner before leveling out across the middle and then beginning to drop again on the right side. �Labeled <i>Nighthawk Descent Profile</i>, the chart had something to do with the altitude, speed and distance of the aircraft. But he kept his attention glued to the central display, where a global satellite map showed the Pacific Ocean and the west coasts of North, South and Central America.</p><p>Icons representing the <i>Nighthawk</i> and lines tracing its path were drawn in bright colors. Because the <i>Nighthawk</i> flew in an unusual polar orbit, the reentry path originated over Antarctica, cutting across the globe at a diagonal angle. It had flown past New Zealand, passing to the east by less than a hundred miles, and from there it drew a line directly over the top of the Cook Islands and Tahiti. It passed south of Hawaii, and its projection continued toward Vandenberg and the high deserts of California. It still had several thousand miles to go, but traveling at over five thousand miles per hour meant less than forty minutes before touchdown.</p><p>An echoing call rang out over the loudspeaker system, known as the loop. &#x201c;Vehicle has cleared Max Q,&#x201d; an anonymous voice said. &#x201c;Heat shield secure. Temperatures dropping.&#x201d;</p><p><i>Max Q. </i>That was a term Gowdy knew. <i>A</i> <i>danger point</i>&#x2014;<i>the point of maximum aerodynamic stress on the craft. A point where any weakness or damage would likely result in structural failure and loss of the craft.</i></p><p>Hearing that the <i>Nighthawk</i> had passed Max Q reduced Gowdy&#x2019;s anxiety a bit. Many things could still go wrong, catastrophically wrong, but the largest hurdle had been cleared.</p><p>He glanced down to the middle tier of the amphitheater-style room. That level was the domain of the flight director. In this case, an Air Force Colonel named Frank Hansen. Hansen was a steely-eyed veteran of thirty years, a former fighter jock and test pilot who&#x2019;d survived two ejections and a crash in his time and was now head of the 9th Space Operations Squadron.</p><p>Hansen turned, made eye contact and offered a nod. So far, so good.</p><p>Among all the controllers and system specialists and experts, Hansen was the only man in the room&#x2014;aside from Gowdy �himself&#x2014;who understood just what a monumental risk they&nbsp;were taking. And if Gowdy measured him right, Hansen was just as nervous.</p><p>Hansen pressed his intercom switch. &#x201c;Give me a status update,&#x201d; his calm voice called out.</p><p>Down on the lowest level of the room, the individual systems controllers went into action. Each of them had one thing to worry about; guidance, telemetry, propulsion, etc.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Like the front row in a movie theater, their positions made watching the main screen a neck-craning exercise, but since every bit of information they needed was displayed on smaller monitors directly in front of them, they rarely looked up until their tasks were done.</p><p>Gowdy sat back and listened as the stream of replies poured in over the loop, his finger continuing to drum.</p><p>&#x201c;Telemetry: Go.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Electrical: Go.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Flight controls: Go.&#x201d;</p><p>On it went, each man or woman reporting, confirming good news, until all the controllers had reported in but one.</p><p>An awkward pause ensued. Down below, Hansen waited and then pressed the button on his transmitter. &#x201c;Guidance, what&#x2019;s your status?&#x201d;</p><p>There was no response.</p><p>&#x201c;Guidance?&#x201d;</p><p>The room went deathly quiet. Gowdy&#x2019;s finger stopped its tapping. In all the simulations, he&#x2019;d never heard a delay, not even a few seconds. He stood up, gazing down over the rail toward the bottom row, where the guidance controller sat.</p><p>A young airman with a crew cut was working furiously, typing and tapping things on his keyboard, switching screens.</p><p>&#x201c;Guidance?&#x201d; Hansen called out. &#x201c;I need a response.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Guidance is go,&#x201d; the airman finally replied, &#x201c;but we&#x2019;re seeing a delay in the repeat.&#x201d;</p><p>Because the <i>Nighthawk</i> was a pilotless craft and controlled remotely from Vandenberg, the system had been designed to �repeat every instruction back to control center before executing a maneuver, much in the way a pilot repeated the instructions to&nbsp;air traffic control to make sure everyone was on the same page.</p><p>Gowdy tapped his own intercom button, which went directly,&nbsp;and privately, to Hansen. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s happening? What does it mean?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A delay in the repeat could be anything,&#x201d; Hansen replied. He spoke with a practiced indifference. &#x201c;It could mean a problem processing the command, an error on our end, or even&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>Before anything else could be said, the Telemetry controller spoke up. &#x201c;Telemetry is yellow. Signal intermittent.&#x201d;</p><p>On the big screen with the numbers, two boxes had begun flashing yellow alarms; a third began to flash red.</p><p>&#x201c;Course deviation detected,&#x201d; the tracking controller said. &#x201c;Two degrees south and turning&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Five degrees and �turning&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>Gowdy felt his throat clench up. He buzzed Hansen again. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s happening?&#x201d;</p><p>Hansen was too busy to reply and Gowdy turned his gaze back to the screen. The <i>Nighthawk</i>&#x2019;s projected line had begun to curve, angling to the right, away from California and toward Central America.</p><p>&#x201c;Eleven degrees south and still turning,&#x201d; the guidance controller said. &#x201c;Speed dropping, descent arrested. Altitude maintaining nine-one thousand.&#x201d;</p><p>Gowdy could hardly believe his eyes. Instead of descending as planned, the <i>Nighthawk</i> was leveling off at ninety-one thousand feet and losing speed because of it. Since the craft was a glider at this point, it was imperative that it maintain the proper descent profile; otherwise, it would bleed off so much speed that it would no longer be able to reach California.</p><p>Gowdy felt his legs shaking. He gripped the rail in front of him with one hand while the other went into his pocket, fumbling for a key.</p><p>&#x201c;Reissue directional commands,&#x201d; Hansen called out tersely.</p><p>&#x201c;No effect,&#x201d; the controller said.</p><p>&#x201c;Reboot command program.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Reboot initiated&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Stand by.&#x201d;</p><p>Gowdy descended the stairs to Hansen&#x2019;s level and held his position. He was sweating now, his hands trembling, his fingers on the key he hoped never to use.</p><p><i>How could it all be going wrong now? A decade of research and three years in space. How could the effort possibly be failing here at the end?</i></p><p>&#x201c;Twenty-one degrees south,&#x201d; the guidance controller said. &#x201c;Altitude still nine-one thousand, speed dropping to four thousand.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s happening?&#x201d; Gowdy shouted to Hansen, no longer bothering with the intercom or the pretense of calm.</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve lost control.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I can see that,&#x201d; Gowdy replied. &#x201c;Why?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Impossible to tell,&#x201d; Hansen said. &#x201c;It seems to be a constant right turn. There may be damage to the wing or vertical stabilizer. But that wouldn&#x2019;t explain the telemetry problems or the delay on the command repeat.&#x201d;</p><p>Gowdy fumbled with the key in his pocket, turning it over and over in his hand. It was his responsibility to terminate the mission if it became too dangerous; his call. To act early before all hope was gone would be a mistake, but to act too late&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. could be disastrous.</p><p>He stepped forward, barging into Hansen&#x2019;s personal space. &#x201c;Get this damned thing back on track.&#x201d;</p><p>Hansen pushed past him, all but shoving Gowdy into a seat. The two men had never liked each other. Hansen felt Gowdy didn&#x2019;t know enough about physics and astronautics to be attached to the program, and Gowdy considered the Air Force Colonel to be arrogant and condescending to his authority. The higher-ups had ordered them to get along; it had worked for a while, but not now.</p><p>&#x201c;Transponder data intermittent,&#x201d; the telemetry controller said. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re losing the signal.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Reboot the transponder,&#x201d; Hansen called out. &#x201c;If the transponder goes out, we&#x2019;ll lose track of the vehicle. It&#x2019;s not in primary radar coverage.&#x201d;</p><p>Gowdy sat, immobile. His body went numb and he listened to&nbsp;the desperate exchange as if in a trance. It wouldn&#x2019;t matter if they were in radar coverage, the <i>Nighthawk</i> was designed with a complete stealth covering. Unlike other spacecraft, it was black in color, invisible to telescopes. It was covered with the most advanced radar-absorbent material ever developed.</p><p>He looked up. The vehicle was now streaking toward the coast of South America at thirty-five hundred miles per hour. Its turn was moderating, its speed continuing to drop. Its maximum glide path, marked by a shaded orange circle on the map, was shrinking with each second and moving south. It no longer reached the United States.</p><p>Gowdy knew what he had to do. There was no more reason to&nbsp;wait.</p><p>He pulled the red key out of his pocket and inserted it into a slot on the panel in front of him. A turn of the key opened a compartment just above it and a small pedestal rose up and locked in place. The pedestal was marked with yellow and black chevrons. In the center loomed a red button protected by raised metal bars that prevented it from being pressed by accident.</p><p>Gowdy looked up at the screen. They were now getting erroneous position data indicating the <i>Nighthawk</i> was in several different places at the same time. Returns blinked on and off, but the main line continued to head south, heading straight for the Gal�pagos Islands and the coast of Ecuador beyond.</p><p>&#x201c;Guidance reboot completed,&#x201d; the controller said.</p><p>&#x201c;And?!&#x201d; Hansen asked.</p><p>&#x201c;No response.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s it,&#x201d; Gowdy whispered. He turned the key to the right and the red button lit up.</p><p><i>&#x201c;Self-destruct, armed,&#x201d; </i>a computer voice called out.</p><p>Letting go of the key, Gowdy reached for the button.</p><p>A firm hand intercepted him, grabbing his wrist and yanking it away.</p><p>Hansen had appeared at his side. &#x201c;Are you insane?&#x201d; the Air Force Colonel growled.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s gone off course,&#x201d; Gowdy said. &#x201c;We can&#x2019;t have it coming down in a populated area, the risk is too great that the worst will happen.&#x201d;</p><p>Hansen continued to hold Gowdy&#x2019;s arm back. &#x201c;<i>The</i> <i>worst </i>has already happened. It happened the moment we brought the <i>Nighthawk</i> and its cargo back into the atmosphere. Destroying it now will only trigger the catastrophe.&#x201d;</p><p>Gowdy blinked, confused. He felt a sense of vertigo. He truly didn&#x2019;t understand. But then, this was what Hansen had complained about all along. The science was beyond him.</p><p>The <i>Nighthawk</i> suddenly vanished from the screen. The graph showing its descent profile went blank and all the numbers in the far screen froze and began to blink red.</p><p>&#x201c;Telemetry is down,&#x201d; another controller reported with little emotion. &#x201c;<i>Nighthawk</i> contact lost.&#x201d;</p><p>A murmur swept through the room. It sounded like fear. Gowdy stared at the screen, waiting and hoping the course line would reappear. He sat in silence as repeated attempts to reestablish the link between Vandenberg and the aircraft failed.</p><p>Eventually, a new number appeared on the screen and began rapidly counting toward zero.</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s that?&#x201d; Gowdy asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Surface interface time,&#x201d; Hansen said with grim honesty. &#x201c;The longest possible time the <i>Nighthawk</i> can remain aloft before reaching zero altitude.&#x201d;</p><p>The number ticked down without mercy, going from minutes to seconds and then stopping implacably at 0:00:00.</p><p>&#x201c;Now what?&#x201d; Gowdy asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Give me live satellite coverage,&#x201d; Hansen ordered. &#x201c;Wide-angle. South Pacific and western South America.&#x201d;</p><p>The controllers did as ordered. No one asked why.</p><p>One by one, the satellite views came up. Gowdy stared at the peaceful scene. Clouds drifted over the Pacific. The west coast of South America ran hard against the blue waters of the ocean. The tropical disturbance in the Pacific swirled like a peaceful merry-go-round.</p><p>Everything appeared calm.</p><p>&#x201c;What are you looking for?&#x201d; Gowdy asked.</p><p>The stern Air Force Colonel turned to the NSA bureaucrat he&#x2019;d put up with for so long and exhaled. It was more relief than frustration.</p><p>&#x201c;Absent a command from the ground, the <i>Nighthawk</i> will enter an autonomous mode, thinking for itself. When it determines its own position and computes that it can&#x2019;t reach Vandenberg, the craft will execute emergency descent procedures, slow to an appropriate speed and then land safely&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. by parachute.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;How do you know it hasn&#x2019;t broken up already?&#x201d; Gowdy replied, trying to reassert his aura of authority. &#x201c;How do you know the autoland system hasn&#x2019;t failed like everything else?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Because,&#x201d; Hansen said, &#x201c;we&#x2019;re still here.&#x201d;</p><p>It took a moment, but Gowdy began to understand. He looked up at the live satellite view and all the normal things it displayed. &#x201c;How long do we have?&#x201d;</p><p>Hansen performed a quick mental calculation. &#x201c;Seven days,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Less, if the fuel cells, solar panels or the battery packs were damaged.&#x201d;</p><p>Gowdy turned back to the screen and the massive expanse of the South Pacific on display. Seven days to search all that ocean and find a needle in its watery haystack. Seven days to find and shut off a ticking bomb that could shake the very foundations of the Earth.</p></p><h2>Grief Counseling and Grief Therapy, Fifth Edition: A Handbook for the Mental Health Practitioner &#x2013; Grief Counseling Handbook on Treatment of Grief, Loss and Bereavement, Book and Free eBook</h2><p>Encompassing new content on the treatment of grief, loss, and bereavement, the updated and revised fifth edition of this gold-standard grief therapy book continues to deliver the most up-to-date research and practical information for upper-level students and practitioners alike.

If we really live in the moment, our worries and hardships will disappear and we will discover life with all its miracles.&#x201d;<br><br>Real life can only be found and touched in the here and now. This is because the present moment is the only moment we can actually influence. The past is over and the future has not yet arrived. Since the present moment is the only real moment for us, we can always return here to get in touch with the wonders of life.<br><br>Thich Nhat Hanh regards living in the moment as the key requirement for one&#x2019;s own freedom. He says, As long as we are consumed with our everyday problems distress, regrets about the past or constant worries about the future we cannot be free people; we are not able to live in the here and now.&#x201d;<br></p><h2>The Humans (Revised TCG Edition)</h2><p><b>Winner of the 2016 Tony Award for Best Play</b><br><br><b>Finalist for the 2016 Pulitzer Prize for Drama</b><br><br><b>Winner of the Outer Critics Circle Award for Outstanding New Broadway Play</b><br><br><b>Winner of the New York Drama Critics&#x2019; Circle Award for Best Play</b><br><br><b> THE BEST PLAY OF THE YEAR&#x201d;</b> --<i>The New York Times, The Washington Post, New York Magazine,<br>Chicago Tribune, The Hollywood Reporter, Time Out New York, NPR</i><br><br><p>"Drawn in subtle but indelible strokes, Mr. Karam's play might almost qualify as deep-delving reportage, so clearly does it illuminate the current, tremor-ridden landscape of contemporary America.

For all the darkness at its core a darkness made literal in its ghostly conclusion a bright light shines forth from it, the blazing luminescence of collective artistic achievement."<br>--Charles Isherwood, <i>The New York Times</i><br><br>"Great plays are usually great in one of two ways. Either they are culminating examples of existing ideas, or groundbreaking examples of new things entirely.<br> <i>The Humans</i>, it turns out, is not just one of those culminating genre pieces but also, at the same time, one of those new things entirely.&#x201d; Into the familiar dinner-table-drama genre the playwright has mixed the unexpected element of terror or, rather, he has created a new element by bombarding one with the other.

You watch them drive each other crazy, but you also want them at your own dinner, quite badly.

You&#x2019;ll be glad you&#x2019;ve been invited into the company of the Blakes, who themselves may fall short of glamorous but nevertheless help class up the whole darn neighborhood." Peter Marks, --<i>The Washington Post</i><br><br> beautifully wrought... Having limned <i>The Humans</i> with gorgeous naturalism, Karam boldly forces us into a world beyond the familiar.&#x201d;<br>--Adam Feldman, <i>Time Out NY</i><br><br> There is so much love, dread, and tenderness in <i>The Humans</i> that it is hard to believe just 90 minutes pass through Stephen Karam&#x2019;s deeply-felt family tragicomedy. Beautifully wrought <i>The Humans</i> burrows into the lives of an Irish-American family with wit, tenderness and blistering brutality.&#x201d;<br>--Linda Winer, <i>Newsday</i><br><br> Karam, whose flair for character and context was evident in the 2012 Pulitzer Prize finalist Sons of the Prophet, isn't interested in a polemic. <i>The Humans</i> rather considers the trials its highly imperfect subjects face in a highly imperfect world, and resolves, without ever approaching sentimentality, that love is nonetheless resilient.&#x201d;<br>--Elysa, Gardner, <i>USA Today</i><br><br> It is an absolute triumph.&#x201d; --Mark Kennedy, <i>Associated Press</i><br><br> A play of uncommon strengths; fresh, funny, piercing and perceptive. <i>The Humans</i> isn&#x2019;t just a family portrait it&#x2019;s a mirror. Karam has an eye for detail on a near cellular level, an ear for authentic dialogue and a superlative ability to balance laughter and sorrow.&#x201d; --Joe Dziemianowicz, <i>New York Daily News</i><br><br> The formula for a family-reunion play goes like this: Multiple generations of a clan get together for a holiday, air their dirty laundry at dinner, start fighting over dessert and at the end of the day are weary of battle. Stephen Karam&#x2019;s warm-hearted play <i>The Humans</i> follows the formula, but only to the point of exposing everybody&#x2019;s secrets. Instead of erupting in bitter hatred, Karam&#x2019;s characters respond to these revelations with deep love. That alone should keep this lovely play, an Off Broadway transfer, running in its inviting new Broadway house until kingdom come.&#x201d; <br>--Marilyn Stasio, <i>Variety</i><br><br> a quietly stunning new play by Stephen Karam <br>the beat-by-beat honesty, wit and intelligence of the writing kept me alert to every changing nuance. It has completely earned its place on the Broadway stage; and does so without the supposed benefit of star casting. What will sell it is the play itself.&#x201d; --Martin Shenton, <i>The Stage</i><br><br> <i>The Humans</i>, which arrives on Broadway after an acclaimed off-Broadway run last fall, is a funny, mournful, richly detailed and deeply humane study of a beleaguered family celebrating Thanksgiving dinner in a tumbledown Chinatown apartment. Menu aside, it is no turkey.&#x201d; --Alexis Soloski, <i>The Guardian</i><br><br> This is your life and it is petrifying. We feel a tidal wave of emotion at <i>The Humans</i>. It is painfully uncanny so much so that you won&#x2019;t be able to look away. Never has there been a more realistic encapsulation of the electricity generated when multiple generations come together under one roof.&#x201d;<br>--Zachary Stewert, <i>Theatremania</i><br><br>"There&#x2019;s no plate-smashing moment that you see in more histrionic family-gathering dramas (all the flatware in Brigid&#x2019;s apartment is plastic anyway). Each of the Blakes, even Momo, are masking major tragedies in their lives, but even those are revealed in ways that feel utterly unforced. Some moments are absolutely devastating but it&#x2019;s unfair to label the play as simply depressing,&#x201d; because it&#x2019;s depressing in the way life is depressing and hilarious in the way life is hilarious <br> Karam&#x2019;s transcendently mundane play is a reminder that family dinner dramas can still be surprising and they doesn&#x2019;t need ghosts or things that go bump in the night to achieve that.

By reading the body maps, one can treat both physical symptoms and their emotional causes more directly. Physical ailments are relieved when the flower essences are applied to the skin, and underlying emotional problems improve more rapidly after topical treatment than after taking the drops orally. Preventive treatments are also possible using the body maps. <br>The author demonstrates that the effectiveness of the flower remedies is greatly increased when they are applied in the form of compresses or ointments. <br><br>Kramer's procedures are illustrated by many case studies which confirm the effectiveness of this significant new extension of Bach Flower Therapy. <br><br>Bach Flower Remedies are also used in beauty therapy. Many practical examples illustrate the use of Bach Flowers in skin care.</p><p>Dietmar Kramer, a licensed naturopath in his native Germany, has been active as a practitioner and teacher of holistic health care since 1983.

They found it too difficult or too frightening or just decided that for them it was too late. But as a therapist and trauma survivor herself, Dr. Schmelzer wants us to know that it is never too late to heal from trauma, whether it is the suffering caused within an abusive relationship or PTSD resulting from combat. Sometimes what feels like a big setback is actually an unexpected difficult step forward. So she wrote Journey Through Trauma specifically for survivors--to help them understand the terrain of the healing process and stay on the path.<br> There are three basic principles that every trauma survivor should know: Healing is possible. It requires courage. And it cannot be done alone. Traumas that happen more than once--child abuse, sexual abuse, domestic violence, gang violence, even war--are all relational traumas. They happened inside a relationship and therefore must be healed inside a relationship, whether that relationship is with a therapist or within a group. <br> Journey Through Trauma gives us a map to help guide us through that healing process, see where the hard parts show up, and persevere in the process of getting well. We learn the five phases that every survivor must negotiate along the way and come to understand that since the cycle of healing is not linear, circling back around to a previous stage does not mean defeat - it actually means progress as well as facing new challenges. <br> Authoritative and accessible, Journey Through Trauma provides support for survivors and their loved ones through one of the most challenging but necessary processes of healing that anyone can face.</p><p><b>Gretchen Schmelzer, PhD,</b> is a licensed psychologist, trained as a Harvard Medical School Fellow. She is a trauma survivor who has worked for twenty-five years with the complex issues of trauma, integration, and behavior change across every level, from individuals to groups to large systems and countries. She has worked with individuals and groups in large clinics and clinics in housing projects, in residential treatment facilities, in psychiatric units and medical hospital units, and in private practice. She has more than a decade of experience working with traumatized children and adolescents in residential treatment and psychiatric units. She is the founder and editor of <i>The Trail Guide</i>, a web-mag featured on www.gretchenschmelzer.com dedicated to healing repeated trauma.Dear Reader,<br><br>There are so many things I want you to know. I want you to know that healing from trauma is possible. I want you to understand how being hurt, how living through trauma, how the difficult act of survival has affected you. I want you to know how all the things you did to survive and protect yourself have saved your life and how they may also now be robbing you of the life you could live. How they could be robbing you of your ability to do the work you want to do in the way you want to do it. How they could be robbing you of your important relationships with the people you love and who love you. And most especially robbing you of a relationship with yourself: of any kindness or compassion toward yourself. I want you to understand this because understanding how trauma has impacted you helps you know why the hard work of healing is worth it.<br> &nbsp;<br> I want you to know that healing is possible regardless of how long it has taken you to get here. No matter when you come to healing, it is possible. I know that many of you think that it isn&#x2019;t. I know you believe that it is too late. But actually, it&#x2019;s never too late. However old or young you are, healing is possible. Our brains are malleable and they continue to grow throughout our lives. The brain&#x2019;s ability to grow is what allowed for our survival, and that same plasticity allows for our healing. It will take work. It will take help. It will take practice and persistence. It may involve tears, sadness, anger, and frustration. But it is possible.<br> &nbsp;<br> I want you to understand how trauma works&#x2014;how it impacts brains and bodies. I want you to understand the genius of our brains and bodies for survival. For getting us through. I want you to understand the mechanisms of trauma because understanding them will help you understand yourself, and will help you know what to expect in the process of healing. I want you to understand how trauma works so that when you catch yourself doing certain things, your attitude isn&#x2019;t mean or judgmental&#x2014;but instead you think to yourself: <i>Of course, this is what I do</i>. And then you have the ability to say: What else can I do? Understanding how it all works gives you a solid platform from which to grow and leap and try new things.<br> &nbsp;<br> I want you to understand that all that turmoil that can happen inside you makes sense. You aren&#x2019;t crazy. This is just what happens when you survive trauma. That doesn&#x2019;t mean that what you are feeling feels good, or how you are behaving is necessarily the best thing for you or is supporting your relationships. It means that what you are feeling and how you are acting makes sense in the context of surviving trauma.<br> &nbsp;<br> I want you to understand that all trauma is not the same. It can look like it if you are trying to find information on the Internet. If you look up post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) you will find a list of symptoms and a set of recommendations. But it is not all the same. Just as physical trauma is not all the same. If you were run over by a car, there couldn&#x2019;t possibly be a standard protocol for your healing. It would entirely depend on how the car hit you&#x2014;did it break your arm or leg? Cause a head injury? Internal bleeding? And psychological trauma is no different. Trauma is the very definition of something being utterly shattered. And what gets shattered differs for each person.<br> &nbsp;<br> And I especially want you to understand what I call <i>repeated trauma</i>. This is the trauma that happens more than once. There is a big difference between the trauma that happens one time, like a car accident, and the trauma that gets repeated. If you are in a car accident, a whole host of responses are expected from any onetime trauma. When a traumatic event happens once, humans are generally spurred into action by their biology&#x2014;a huge release of adrenaline that makes you ready to fight, ready to act, and that sharpens your memory of the event so you can remember it clearly to protect yourself from it in the future.<br> &nbsp;<br> But what if instead you were in a car accident every day for years? It sounds crazy&#x2014;a car accident every day for years&#x2014;but this is exactly what it is like when traumatic acts are continually repeated, as they are for people who live through war, or child abuse, or sexual abuse, or domestic violence, or gang violence. When trauma gets repeated we have a different set of reactions. Our human physiology is built for efficiency. Traumatic events require a lot of energy. Our brains and bodies tell us that we can&#x2019;t afford that much energy and attention. So if trauma gets repeated, instead of gearing up, we go numb. When a smoke alarm goes off in your house once, you pay attention; if it goes off every day, then you cut the wires or pull the battery so you don&#x2019;t have to hear it anymore. Going numb is the trauma equivalent of pulling the battery on the smoke alarm. Going numb serves the important purpose of allowing us to go on with our lives. It is what allows soldiers to keep fighting, and survivors in war zones to keep living. It is what allows abused children to keep going to school. It keeps you from taking in each new act of violence. It protects you from the extremes of emotion that could affect your memory, your health, and your safety. It is the emergency response system that your body automatically employs when trauma gets repeated&#x2014;hunkering down so you can conserve energy.<br> &nbsp;<br> So, repeated trauma isn&#x2019;t just about what happened to you. It is also about how you survived it. It is about how you protected yourself from the years of it. In order to understand why it is so hard to heal from trauma, it is important to understand that repeated trauma is really three aspects of trauma that combine to make up what we call repeated trauma. The first aspect of repeated trauma is <i>what did happen</i>&#x2014;the experiences<br> of terror and helplessness that you remember. The second aspect of repeated trauma is <i>what aided survival</i>&#x2014;the protections you created to survive the trauma, the ways that you shut down or geared up or escaped. And the third aspect of repeated trauma is <i>what didn&#x2019;t happen</i>&#x2014;the growth and development you missed because you were surviving being hurt, the help you didn&#x2019;t get, the conversations you didn&#x2019;t learn to have, the skills of everyday life that you missed learning. Healing from trauma requires you to work with and repair all three.<br> &nbsp;<br> I also want you to know that no one heals alone. You will need to find help in order to heal. This book is a way to understand the impact of trauma that you lived through, how you protected yourself, and what you missed in your growth. It is a way to understand the impact of what happened to you and how you may be still living as if the trauma could still get you, as if it were still happening. But this is not a self-help book. This is a how-to-understand-and-use-help book. It is a what-to-expect-from-trauma-treatment book. This book demands that you get help, but it also provides the information you need to feel empowered and secure in your helping relationship.<br> &nbsp;<br> Understanding trauma is not enough to heal it. Healing from trauma requires leaning your weight on the support of a therapeutic relationship in order to let the traumatized parts of yourself heal. If you broke your leg and didn&#x2019;t use crutches to take your weight off the broken leg, you couldn&#x2019;t properly heal the break. It is the same with trauma. Some of you may choose a therapist: a psychiatrist, psychologist, social worker, counselor, or member of the clergy. Some of you may choose some form of group therapy. But I am telling you up front, at the beginning: in order to heal, you will need to get help. I know you will try to look for the loophole in this argument&#x2014;try to find a way that you can do this on your own&#x2014;but you need to trust me on this. If there were a way to do it on your own I would have found it. No one looked harder for that loophole than I did.<br> &nbsp;<br> The problem isn&#x2019;t that you or I aren&#x2019;t self-sufficient enough. Or strong-willed or brave or tough or hardworking enough. The problem is that the trauma most people experience happens between people. I&#x2019;m not talking about the traumas that are natural disasters&#x2014;tornadoes or hurricanes. I&#x2019;m not talking about car accidents or medical illnesses, even though all of these things can be traumatic. I am talking about relational disasters&#x2014;the<br> nightmares of people perpetrating violence and terror on other people: war, child abuse, domestic violence. That is what most psychological traumas are&#x2014;they are <i>repeated relational traumas</i>.<br> &nbsp;<br> And herein lies one of the most difficult paradoxes of trying to get help when your problem is trauma: you have to get help in order to heal, and because the trauma happened in a relationship, it is very hard to believe in and trust help. It&#x2019;s the moral equivalent of surviving a plane crash and being told that the only way to get help is by getting therapy on a plane every week. I want you to understand that the things you did to survive being hurt repeatedly are the very things that can get in the way of asking for and trusting help. This is a normal and expected response to repeated trauma. This doesn&#x2019;t mean there is something wrong with you. It means that you did a good job surviving and now you have the difficult task of healing.<br> &nbsp;<br> And even though you can&#x2019;t heal alone, and you will need help, healing from trauma is still your job. The trauma that happened to you wasn&#x2019;t your fault, but healing from your trauma is your responsibility. Only you can do the hard work of healing your trauma&#x2014;no one else can do it for you. Your therapist or group can help guide you and be there with you along the way. And your family and loved ones can support you and cheer you from the sidelines. But no one can fix it for you. This is your journey. Your healing belongs to you. You are creating your life, and your healing is your accomplishment&#x2014;the gift you give to yourself and the people in your life.<br> &nbsp;<br> Healing takes a lot of hard work, and you will likely feel worse before you feel better. Healing from trauma doesn&#x2019;t mean that in the end you will feel great all the time in the same way that a &#x201c;happy childhood&#x201d; doesn&#x2019;t mean that kids are happy all the time. Happy childhoods are filled with lots of struggles and difficult moments. Complete and utter meltdowns occur for all the good reasons that children need to have them. Happy childhoods aren&#x2019;t happy because the kids are always smiling. They are happy because the kids are free to grow up&#x2014;to focus on their own growth and development&#x2014;in a safe enough environment that supports that growth. Growth can be hard. And a healthy adulthood, or an adulthood where you have healed your trauma, doesn&#x2019;t mean you are never sad or angry or frustrated. It doesn&#x2019;t mean never getting triggered by your trauma again. Healthy means whole; it means you get to have a self, with all of its complexities. It means you get to have a whole life made up of all your experiences: the traumatic ones and the nontraumatic ones. It means that you have the right to have all the ups and downs of normal growth and development for your developmental age. It means that you are living in the present with a sense of a future&#x2014;not just surviving or living in an ever-present past, protecting yourself from what has already happened.<br> &nbsp;<br> I am writing about trauma because I believe it is possible to heal. I believe it because I have seen it. I have worked as a therapist for over two decades in large clinics, clinics in housing projects, in residential treatment facilities, on psychiatric units and medical hospital units, and in private practice. I have worked with survivors of World War II, the Khmer Rouge, Vietnam, and 9/11. I have worked with survivors of childhood physical and sexual abuse, domestic violence, and community violence. I have seen people struggle through their trauma and come out on the other side.<br> &nbsp;<br> But my motivation for writing this particular book&#x2014;about what the healing process is actually like&#x2014;is also that I have watched many people who experience trauma give up. I have watched them give up on treatment, give up on themselves, on relationships or jobs that were important to them. I have watched them despair and lose hope. I have watched them start the healing process and not know ahead of time that the road to healing is difficult; it is steep. They hit hard spots. They think they are going to &#x201c;feel better&#x201d; and instead find that working with trauma is challenging, and that it brings up lots of painful feelings and memories. I have watched as their old protections or defenses begin to crack, or they know they need to give them up and they hit the inevitable long and difficult stretches of healing, the relapses, the setbacks, the slowness of the healing process&#x2014;and they think, <i>This is impossible. I can&#x2019;t do it anymore.</i> And they quit.<br> &nbsp;<br> And I understand why they quit. I have wanted to quit many times myself. I am not only a psychologist who has helped others with their trauma, I have lived through it myself. I grew up with the stories of trauma that my parents lived in their childhood, and the terror and fear that they created in our household&#x2014;to watch my mother taken away in an ambulance, unconscious after being hit, or to stand for hours while she screamed in a rage, not knowing who she was talking to. I know what it is to watch my brother get slammed against the wall because he didn&#x2019;t put his napkin in his lap, or to watch as furniture got broken. I know what it feels like to feel terror, and I know what it feels like to live with the consequences of that terror. I understand and believe in healing from trauma because I have guided others, but I believe it in my bones because I have traveled these difficult miles of healing myself.<br> &nbsp;<br> Healing from trauma is not an event or a linear process. It is a series of cycles that spiral through recognizable phases. These are stages you will cycle through again and again as you move toward health and wholeness. This new method of healing allows you to know where you are, what the work is, what the challenges are, and what you can do to move through the stages gaining the healing and learning you need. So I have written this book as a trail guide, as a way to know and recognize the terrain of the work that you are doing, of the healing you are seeking. This is not a book about other people&#x2019;s stories, and it is not even entirely my story, though I will speak to some of my experiences and the experiences of others to deepen your understanding where I can. This book is intended to be as accurate a description of the trail and the territory as I can give you so that you can make your own journey, create your own maps, tell your story, and heal from trauma.</p><h2>Audition</h2><p><p><strong>The long-awaited translation of the novel behind the cult classic Japanese movie.</strong></p><p>In this gloriously over-the-top tale, Aoyama, a widower who has lived alone with his son ever since his wife died seven years before, finally decides it is time to remarry.

But mere conflict resolution and peacemaking are not enough. What makes real reconciliation possible? How is it that some people are able to forgive the most horrendous of evils? And what role does God play in these stories? Does reconciliation make any sense apart from the biblical story of redemption? Secular models of peacemaking are insufficient. And the church has not always fulfilled its call to be agents of reconciliation in the world. In <em>Reconciling All Things</em> Emmanuel Katongole and Chris Rice, codirectors of the Center for Reconciliation at Duke Divinity School, cast a comprehensive vision for reconciliation that is biblical, transformative, holistic and global. They draw on the resources of the Christian story, including their own individual experiences in Uganda and Mississippi, to bring solid, theological reflection to bear on the work of reconciling individuals, groups and societies. They recover distinctively Christian practices that will help the church be both a sign and an agent of God's reconciling love in the fragmented world of the twenty-first century. This powerful, concise book lays the philosophical foundations for reconciliation and explores what it means to pursue hope in areas of brokenness in theory and practice.</p><p>&#34;Rather than suggesting formulaic or easy steps, Father Emmanuel Katongole and Chris Rice challenge their readers to embody a spirituality that reconciles. With the compelling texture of real-life stories, the credibility of their own journeys in reconciliation, and humble yet profound theological reflections, Emmanuel and Chris offer an accessible and fresh entry point for the crucial conversations on reconciliation.&#34;For more information, visit Duke Divinity School&#39;s Center for Reconciliation.</p><h2>The Train to Crystal City: FDR&#39;s Secret Prisoner Exchange Program and America&#39;s Only Family Internment Camp During World War II</h2><p>The <i>New York Times</i> bestselling dramatic and never-before-told story of a secret FDR-approved American internment camp in Texas during World War II: &#x201c;A must-read....<i>The Train to Crystal City </i>is compelling, thought-provoking, and impossible to put down&#x201d; (<i>Star-Tribune</i>, Minneapolis).<br><br>During World War II, trains delivered thousands of civilians from the United States and Latin America to Crystal City, Texas. The trains carried Japanese, German, and Italian immigrants and their American-born children. The only family internment camp during the war, Crystal City was the center of a government prisoner exchange program called &#x201c;quiet passage.&#x201d; Hundreds of prisoners in Crystal City were exchanged for other more ostensibly important Americans&#x2014;diplomats, businessmen, soldiers, and missionaries&#x2014;behind enemy lines in Japan and Germany.<br> <br>&#x201c;In this quietly moving book&#x201d; (<i>The Boston Globe</i>), Jan Jarboe Russell focuses on two American-born teenage girls, uncovering the details of their years spent in the camp; the struggles of their fathers; their families&#x2019; subsequent journeys to war-devastated Germany and Japan; and their years-long attempt to survive and return to the United States, transformed from incarcerated enemies to American loyalists. Their stories of day-to-day life at the camp, from the ten-foot high security fence to the armed guards, daily roll call, and censored mail, have never been told.<br> <br>Combining big-picture World War II history with a little-known event in American history, <i>The Train to Crystal City</i> reveals the war-time hysteria against the Japanese and Germans in America, the secrets of FDR&#x2019;s tactics to rescue high-profile POWs in Germany and Japan, and above all, &#x201c;is about identity, allegiance, and home, and the difficulty of determining the loyalties that lie in individual human hearts&#x201d; (<i>Texas Observer</i>).</p><p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of the Month, January 2015:</strong> By now, most Americans past high school have learned something about the internment of Japanese-Americans after the bombing of Pearl Harbor in 1940; until recently a not-much-discussed piece of history&#x2014;the internment of citizens mostly born on our soil&#x2014;was, to many, a blight on the human rights record of the Roosevelt administration. But what <i>The Train to Crystal City</i> makes clear is that Executive Order 9066, which paved the way for internment of Japanese Americans, was just one of the questionable human rights decisions the wartime administration made. According to this dramatic, copiously detailed but still very readable account, a camp in Crystal City, Texas housed American-born children of German and Italian descent as well as Japanese, and many of those children were traded for &#x201c;more ostensibly important Americans &#x2013; diplomats, businessmen, soldiers, and missionaries&#x201d; who were stuck behind enemy lines. (The program was dubbed the &#x201c;quiet passage.&#x201d;) How did such a thing happen? To find out, author Jan Jarboe Russell looked into government files (surprise: Eleanor Roosevelt did not agree with her husband the president and publicly abhorred internment of &#x201c;Oriental looking people,&#x201d; suggesting that it was un-American) and interviewed now-adult survivors who had been in the camp as children, most notably a Japanese-American girl named Sumi and a German American one named Ingrid. Though the two never met, their stories, taken together, celebrate the pluck and resilience on the part of many survivors. They also paint a vivid picture, all too applicable today, of a country beset by wartime fear, bigotry and governmental misguidance. <i>--Sara Nelson</i></p>Jan Jarboe Russell is the author of the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller, <i>The Train to Crystal City: FDR&#x2019;s Secret Prisoner Exchange Program and America&#x2019;s Only Family Internment Camp During World War II</i>, winner of the Texas Institute of Letters Prize for Best Book of Nonfiction.

It was a brutal six-month campaign that cost the lives of some 7,000 Americans and over 30,000 Japanese.<br><br> This volume, ten years in the writing, recounts the full story of the critical campaign for Guadalcanal and is based on first-time translations of official Japanese Defense Agency accounts and recently declassified U.S. radio intelligence,&nbsp;<i>Guadalcanal</i>&nbsp;recreates the battle&#x2014;on land, at sea, and in the air&#x2014;as never before: it examines the feelings of both American and Japanese soldiers, the strategies and conflicts of their commanders, and the strengths and weaknesses of various fighting units.</p><p>Richard B. Frank was born in Kansas in 1947. He served for almost four years in the United States Army, including a tour of duty in Vietnam as an aerorifle platoon leader with the 101st Airborne Division. He is the author of <b>Guadalcanal</b>.It is fair to say that, if you want to read a good account of the Battle of Guadalcanal on land (as opposed to the battle at sea), you will have to go a long way to find a more comprehensive report than this book. Make no mistake, it is well researched, well put together and well written. The book comprises 880 pages (including Indices) of fine print with an additional 22 pages of glossy B&amp;W photos (39 pictures altogether) placed together at the centre. Having said that, I did personally find particular problems with the index system which frustrated me at first and, as a researcher, it was not as though I was new to the concept! Nevertheless, I am happy to admit that it was me who may have been at fault and for that reason I am happy to write this revised review. Of course, there are books which people read from cover to cover and others which are used purely for research purposes and only consulted as and when needed. For me, this book was expected to fall into that latter category but, almost as soon as I started looking for some specific item of information, I found myself drawn into reading the entire work. It really is that compelling. Altogether, one of the better accounts which scores heavily for attention to detail, depth of research and for being such a darned good read. There really is not much more you could want from any book. --By Ned Middleton<br><br>Richard B. Frank has written what I consider to be the authoritative account of the Guadalcanal campaign of August 1942-February 1943. A military offensive undertaken by the United States seven months after the Japanese attack on the U.S. naval base at Pearl Harbour, the Guadalcanal campaign was marked on both sides by successes as well as by setbacks. What I found particularly fascinating was Richard Frank's detailed description of the Imperial Japanese Navy's three areas of superiority over the U.S. Navy during their naval engagements: (1) highly trained naval gunners and commanders who were well-versed in night fighting naval tactics; (2) night optics/night vision capabilities; (2) the Long Lance torpedo. In a number of instances, Japanese naval lookouts were able to see approaching U.S. Navy ships long before the U.S. Navy could identify Japanese vessels! The superiority of the Long Lance torpedo over its American counterpart (the latter was virtually useless in sinking anything!) allowed the Imperial Japanese Navy to seriously damage or sink a number of American ships. Frank also points out that during the naval encounters off the coast of Guadalcanal, the U.S. Navy utilised radar with mixed results. Land masses - like Savo Island just off the north-west coast of Guadalcanal - produced misleading images on the U.S. Navy's radar screens at night. In addition, with the exception of U.S. Admiral Willis "Ching" Lee who commanded a battleship-based naval task force off the coast of Guadalcanal, few American naval officers had been trained in the use of naval radar and were thus unable to understand or properly exploit this new technology within the confined waters of "Iron Bottom Sound." I was particularly intrigued to read Frank's detailed descriptions of U.S. Marine Major General Alexander Vandegrift's calculated, strikingly bold, even risk-taking tactical dispositions and offensive operations against the Japanese Army, particularly the series of battles along the Matanikau River just west of the U.S. Marine base at Henderson Field. These actions, based on his and his staff's brilliant analyses of the strengths and shortcomings of the Japanese Army, allowed the U.S. Marines to keep the Japanese Army off balance. When the Japanese Army did strike, the Marines more than met the challenge. After all the setbacks and successes, victory came to the Americans in February 1943 with Japan's withdrawal from the island that the Japanese soldiers called "Starvation Island." A companion book to Frank's account of the Guadalcanal campaign, and one that I would highly recommend, is James Jones's autobiographical novel, "The Thin Red Line," based on Jones's experiences as a combat infantryman in the U.S. 25th Infantry Division during the Guadalcanal campaign. Richard Frank's book immortalises those Americans and Japanese who fought on the land, in the air and on the seas in this epochal military campaign. --David Kirk<br><br>After the Americans defeated the Japanese at the battle of Midway, an offensive was planned for the Solomon Islands. The primary target was the island of Guadalcanal. In this book, Mr. Frank describes the landings and the capture of Henderson Field in vivid detail. I was also impressed with his descriptions of the fateful battle of Savo Island, where the Allies lost 4 heavy cruisers to an inferior Japanese force. Admiral Fletcher's decision to remove the carriers is discussed, along with the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal, where the 5 Sullivan brothers died on the U.S.S. Juneau. Perhaps the most interesting part of this book to me was how Mr. Frank not only provides the American viewpoint of the battle, but also the Japanese viewpoint. It was interesting to read about how aircraft and casualty claims were greatly exaggerated by both sides. I also felt that the final chapter was interesting in the way that everything was summarized for the reader. I have been reading books about the Pacific war since I was in the 4th grade, and this is the most comprehensive account of the entire Guadalcanal campaign that I have come across.

H. Auden in <i>For the Time Being</i>. Like seasons, ages are seldom so precise as to end abruptly, while allowing another age to commence. Few events of European history have been as final as the Black Death in bringing to an end one age (which we might call the Innocently Playful Medieval) and bringing into view another (which we might call the Colder Late �Medieval&#x2013;Early Renaissance). But even at this interstice, old forms and old mental states hang on, while new forms and new mental states peek uncertainly into view. Locality often determines how boldly or timidly the new will come to supplant the old; and localities can find their integrity, even their ancient right to existence, open to question. (&#x201c;This village has always been crown territory.&#x201d; &#x201c;But which crown, �En�gland&#x2019;s or France&#x2019;s?&#x201d; &#x201c;Which religion, Christian or Muslim?&#x201d; &#x201c;Oh, and where, pray, is the boundary stone, the definitive separation between Us and Them?&#x201d;)<br><br>At such a crossroads, it is difficult if not impossible to see much farther than one&#x2019;s nose: the watchman&#x2019;s tower is down and the prophet&#x2019;s lantern out. Those who occupy traditional seats of power&#x2014;�those who use signet �rings&#x2014;�may begin to find their perches less stable and secure, more open to question. The ordinary bloke, the commoner attempting to make his way in the world, is all too likely to experience a new if vague sense of unease, of doubt seeping into his pores like unhealthy air. It is not a time of dancing and embracing but of stepping back and taking stock. Yet life goes on: men travel and make deals, as they have always done; monarchs make decisions, as they have always done, with �far-�reaching and often unpredictable consequences.<br><br>1492: COLUMBUS DISCOVERS AMERICA<br><br>One such man was Christopher Columbus, born of undistinguished forebears near Genoa, long a shadowy petitioner at various European courts, now arrived at C�rdoba to the new headquarters of Spanish royalty, the Alc�zar, former stronghold of Muhammad XII, whom Spaniards called Boabdil; and two such monarchs were their Catholic Majesties Ferdinand and Isabella of Spain. The year was a fateful one, 1492. To it, historians, looking backwards, have assigned the final expiration of the Middle Ages and the (as yet unheralded) birth of a new age.<br><br>Many Americans will recall having suffered through a school pageant or two meant to dramatize the monumental encounter between the Genoese ship captain and the Spanish royal couple. And since such dramatizations invariably contain almost as much misinformation as they do historical fact, it is worth revisiting the great moment with a colder eye.<br><br>The ship captain was probably born in 1451 at or very near Genoa, the son of a weaver who also sold cheeses on the streets of Genoa, then of Savona, his son helping out at both locations (&#x201c;Parmigiano! Mozzarella! Gorgonzola!!&#x201d;). The boy would have been called Christoffa Corombo in his native Ligurian, later Crist�bal Col�n by Spaniards. Since documents of any importance were written in Latin, his Latinized name, Christophorus Columbus, which appears in his own hand as well as in other records of the period, was easily �En�glished as Christopher Columbus. Though there have been numerous attempts to render Columbus as Jewish, or even Muslim, and to trace his origins to a European country other than Italy, there is no evidence to support such theories, but there is good evidence to support his birth as an Italian Catholic.<br><br>Genoa and Savona, ports on the Italian Riviera north of Corsica, offered adventurous boys many opportunities for seafaring apprenticeships. Columbus claimed to have first ventured to sea at the age of ten, and there is little reason to doubt him; surely by his late teens he was almost an old salt, and by his early twenties he had already docked as far away as the west coast of Africa, Chios in the Greek Aegean, Bristol on Britain&#x2019;s west coast, Galway at the edge of the Atlantic, and probably Iceland. He also began to act as agent for a consortium of Genoese merchants, who traded far and wide. One of his voyages took him to Lisbon, where a brother, Bartolomeo, worked as a cartographer. In their collaboration we may glimpse the origin of Columbus&#x2019;s great endeavor.<br><br>Thanks to the enormous expansion in world trade that had been booming for more than two centuries, Europeans of means had come to take for granted certain substances that did not originate in Europe, especially the spices, opiates, and silks of faraway Asia. No one (who was anyone) could any longer imagine doing without these things. But the fall of Greek Constantinople to the Ottoman Turks in 1453 had created a profound and permanent alteration in international affairs. It was of course still possible to extract the expected goodies from the Far East, but getting them past the Turks required both more cunning and more �gold&#x2014;�and sometimes more �blood&#x2014;�than had been previously required, considerably raising the price of the beloved commodities by the time they came to market. (Imagine if Americans could no longer afford chocolate, salt, or cocaine, or if most of the �Wal-�Marts closed down.) If Europeans could not dislodge the �Turks&#x2014;�which they could �not&#x2014;�what were they to do? At times, it seemed as if all the best practical minds of Europe were engaged in figuring out how to solve the problem. But think as much as they might, no one could come up with a solution. Except Columbus.<br><br>What he suggested made little sense. He proposed to sail around the world, heading west into the Ocean Sea (as it was then called) till he hit the Island of Cipangu (Japan, as identified in the writings of Marco Polo) or perhaps, if he was especially lucky, the fabulous coast of Cathay (China) itself. Maps of the period, inaccurate about many things, nonetheless show both the principal island of Japan (misshapen and lacking most of its fellow islands) and the coast of a strangely squeezed China. There are even attempts to sketch in the archipelagos of Malaysia and Indonesia.<br><br>The diameter of the spherical Earth had been calculated accurately by the Greek Eratosthenes in the second century BC, and his calculation was still widely known in the time of Columbus. Though no European foresaw what lay in wait for Columbus, since all thought mistakenly that the Ocean Sea, empty of land, was much larger than it was, almost all who could read and had looked into the subject understood that Columbus was seriously underestimating the overall size of the Earth.<br><br>Columbus, basing his calculations on inaccurate assumptions, theorized that the east coast of Asia could be reached by a European ship within a few weeks of its leaving port. The actual circumference of the Earth is about 40,000 kilometers, whereas Columbus assumed it to be closer to 25,000 kilometers. Compounding his mistake was his �misreading&#x2014;�in a Latin �translation&#x2014;�of a renowned �ninth-�century Persian astronomer, Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Kathir �al-�Farghani, known to the West as Alfraganus. The Persian&#x2019;s correct measurements were given in Arabic miles, which Columbus assumed to be the same as Roman miles. In actuality, Roman miles are about 25 percent shorter than Arabic ones. Had the Ocean not held the Americas and the vast sea been empty of land between Europe and Asia, Columbus and his crew, heading west, would have perished in the deep and never been heard from again. This had indeed been the fate of several earlier (and �well-�known) attempts.<br><br>Columbus&#x2019;s good luck lay not in his miserably wrongheaded calculations about distance but in his accurate knowledge of the North Atlantic trade winds, which flow in a great clockwise circle. How he came by this information we can&#x2019;t be sure. It may have been the result of his own observations on his previous voyages, only some of which we know about. In any case, it was information not widely understood at the time, even if in our own day it is common knowledge to transatlantic airline passengers. As a result of his awareness of the �trade-�winds pattern, he was able to keep them at his back, plotting a southerly outgoing course and a northerly homecoming one, both of which enabled him to travel much more quickly than others had been able to do. In this way, Columbus and his crew were saved from contrary winds, becalmings, and death by dehydration on the high seas.<br><br>Columbus was a man of high �color&#x2014;�reddish hair and ruddy cheeks enclosing a long, handsome face, surmounting a towering, tautly muscular �body&#x2014;�and of highly colored personality. People seem either to have been instantly attracted to him or to have taken an instant dislike. He gestured grandly and spoke engagingly and loudly with the confidence of the true aristocrat, which he was not but was determined to become. He always presented himself as a nobleman, alluding vaguely to his familial line and crest, the son certainly not of Italy but of Genoa, la Superba (the Proud One), city of cities, link between Europe and the great globe. Despite his poor resources, he managed to dress well, cutting a fine figure at the European courts he visited. No doubt his admission to the presence of several monarchs in succession was made possible by the convincing show he made. His fair coloring and cool eye (gray or green in different reports) bespoke his northern European genetic origins and assured his welcome by monarchs who were all engaged in marriage games to render their legitimate stock more blond and �blue-�eyed.<br><br>But after he had made his impressive presentation, his proposal would be turned over to the scholars of the court, the people who had read all the books Columbus cited and many more, which he had failed to mention. Inevitably, the scholars would return to their monarch with the same conclusion: Columbus was a crackpot, not an investment opportunity. But, as we know only too well from recent dramas in our financial sector, sooner or later someone somewhere will make the investment. In the event, that someone was Isabella la Cat�lica, reigning Queen of Spain.<br><br>Before this, Columbus had conducted a long dalliance with King John II of Portugal, whom he nearly succeeded in convincing. He sought out financial power brokers in both Genoa and Venice but came up short. He sent his brother Bartolomeo to Henry VII of �En�gland with the astounding proposal. Henry, father to Henry VIII and founder of the Tudor dynasty, whose claim to the throne was quite shaky, said he would think about it. He thought and thought but had nothing more to say (at least not till it was too late). Meanwhile, Columbus found himself at the Spanish court, spending nearly six seemingly sterile years in the attempt to lure the monarchs into financing his scheme.<br><br>Ferdinand and Isabella were not na�fs. Hereditary monarchs and crafty sovereigns, they had created Spain by the ploy of their marriage, uniting Ferdinand&#x2019;s Aragon with Isabella&#x2019;s much larger Castile and then pushing the Iberian Peninsula&#x2019;s one remaining Islamic kingdom into the sea. This last they had accomplished only in March 1492 after years of war and had come to occupy the Alc�zar but minutes (as it were) before Columbus appeared once more to present his final and most eloquent plea. Political to their fingertips, the Catholic Monarchs allowed not a whisper of disagreement to squeeze between them. Their motto, &#x201c;Tanto monta, monta tanto,&#x201d; means something like &#x201c;Each is the same as the other.&#x201d; So don&#x2019;t try any special pleading with one of us.<br><br>Columbus&#x2019;s task was therefore a tricky one, but it seems from the scanty evidence that it was the queen, a woman of exquisite composure and silky speech, whose blue eyes and long gold tresses betrayed her high Castilian and Lancastrian origins, who was especially receptive to Columbus&#x2019;s charm. Though the dark, jowly Ferdinand, whose stubbly beard was incapable of a close shave, would one day boast that he was &#x201c;the principal cause why those islands were discovered,&#x201d; it was Isabella who actually found the way forward for Spain to finance Columbus&#x2019;s expedition. Columbus had already raised about half the needed cash from his Genoese contacts; and Spain, at the end of a long and draining military campaign, was out of cash. So Isabella donated her jewels (or at least some of them), knowing full well that her act of public generosity would necessarily drive all the nobles of Castile (and perhaps even of Aragon and of Ferdinand&#x2019;s other territories) to follow suit in their effort to show themselves at least as generous.<br><br>The year 1492 was a busy one for the Catholic Monarchs. Besides their conquest of the Moorish Kingdom of Granada, they had begun to take considerable interest in the religious observances of their subjects. Like Doctor Johnson in the stagecoach, they felt that false doctrines should be checked and that those who dared espouse such doctrines should be punished by the civil power in union with the church of the realm. Venturing a bit further than Johnson might have done, they �issued&#x2014;�within days of their having situated themselves in the �Alhambra&#x2014;�the Alhambra Decree, expelling all unconverted Jews from Spain.<br><br>As we have already seen in the case of the Black Death, communities of Jews made convenient scapegoats in difficult times. But by this point, Jews had lived among European Christians for the better part of a millennium and a �half&#x2014;�often uneasily, sometimes (as in papal Rome) appreciated for their special skills, sometimes targeted for elimination. In general, insofar as Christians thought about them at all, Jews tended to be considered flawed or partial Christians, believers in the Old Testament but not the New, people �who&#x2014;�inexplicably&#x2014;�failed to see that Jesus was the fulfillment of all their prophecies. They were not universally hated, as were the Muslims (called Moors or, more ominously, Saracens), those who had cooked up a new �religion&#x2014;�really, a �heresy&#x2014;�and stolen the Holy Places from their rightful owners, the Christians. The fast friendship Boccaccio describes between the two Parisian merchants, one Christian, the other Jewish, is a bit harder to imagine occurring between a Christian and a Muslim (at least in a Christian country).<br><br>Selectively admired or merely tolerated, Jews were an expected part of the European social scene. The expulsion from Spain, however, was not their first. On several prior occasions, Jews had been ordered to move en masse from a European country. In 1182 the teenage King Philip II Augustus of France, whose treasury was empty, had seized all Jewish property and forgiven all debts owed to Jews, provided only the debtors pay to the king 20 percent of what they owed. (Sixteen years later, Philip, feeling the adverse effects on French commerce of the departure of the Jews, would allow them to return.) In 1290, Edward I banished all Jews from his kingdom of �En�gland, a ban that remained in effect into the 1600s. In 1306, King Philip IV the Fair (who was not) expelled the Jews of France once again. Though readmitted in 1315, they were expelled once more in 1322, readmitted in 1359, and �re-�expelled in 1394. If the Spanish expulsion seems particularly harsh on account of the huge numbers involved and the efficiency with which results were pursued, it only signaled more execrable banishments to come: by the end of the S...</p><h2>A Mother for Choco</h2><p>Family is about love no matter how different parents and children may be, adopted or not.<br><br>Choco wishes he had a mother, but who could she be? He sets off to find her, asking all kinds of animals, but he doesn't meet anyone who looks just like him. He doesn't even think of asking Mrs. Bear if she's his mother-but then she starts to do just the things a mommy might do. And when she brings him home, he meets her other children-a piglet, a hippo, and an alligator-and learns that families can come in all shapes and sizes and still fit together.<br><br>Keiko Kasza's twist on the "Are you my mother?" theme has become one of the most highly recommended stories about adoption for children.</p><p>Keiko Kasza was born on a small Japanese island in the Inland Sea of Japan. She grew up in a typical Japanese extended family with her parents, two brothers, and grandparents. Uncles, aunts, and cousins also lived nearby. "All the steps I took growing up were very normal," Ms. Kasza says. "The only unusual thing I did was go to college in the United States." She graduated with a degree in graphic design from California State University at Northridge. Ms. Kasza married an American, and the United States has been her home ever since.<p>After publishing five children's books in Japan and working as a graphic designer for fourteen years, Ms. Kasza decided in 1988 to devote her time to picture books. She says, "Having two small boys and two professions was too much to handle."</p><p>Ms. Kasza admires many great picture-book creators, such as Leo Lionni and Maurice Sendak, but says that the work of Arnold Lobel has influenced her the most. The subtle humor and warmth he created in his books continues to inspire me," she says. "I often go back to his work when I get discouraged or lose confidence."</p><p>Ms. Kasza compares the process of making a book to acting on stage under the lights:<br>"I become the character that I'm working on at that moment. I pretend that I'm a bird looking for a mother, or a pig trying to impress his girlfriend. When I'm acting, I'm a child myself."</p><p>Ms. Kasza's ambition is not to create a hundred books, but to "create one really good book that will be kept on the family bookshelves for generations, although a hundred really good books would be even better, of course!"</p><p>Keiko Kasza lives in Indiana with her husband and two sons.</p><p>copyright � 2000 by Penguin Putnam Books for Young Readers.

Cheerful, energetic illustrations decorate the simple but charming taleof a youngster's search for a loving parent. A chubby-faced yellow bird with blue-striped feet, Choco believes that physical similarity is a prerequisite for family relationships. He asks a series of animals who bear even the slightest resemblance to him if they might be his mother, but all turn him away. Discouraged by their rejection, Choco is pleasantly surprised when Mrs. Bear takes an interest in him, plays with and cuddles him, and ultimately offers him a home. The presence of other ``adoptees'' is made obvious as a young alligator, hippopotamus, and pig welcome Choco into his new family. The endearing watercolor paintings are bold and bright enough to appeal to the very youngest listeners, and there is a wealth of character and personality evident in the animals' expressions. These pictures, along with the minimal, repetitive text, make this an excellent choice for storytime use. The emphasis on caring and sharing despite superficial differences will surely find a wide audience. A multicultural message may also be read into this satisfying story with appealing illustrations and a very happy ending. --Lisa Dennis, The Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh<br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Obata&#39;s Yosemite: Art and Letters of Obata from His Trip to the High Sierra in 1927</h2><p>Chiura Obata, a gifted Japanese-born artist from California, made his first trip to Yosemite in 1927.

A modern-day Michelangelo, this twenty year-old is already an established international stage actress, an up-and-coming architect, and the next recipient of the prestigious Akutagawa Prize as Japan's best new writer. Her actions make headlines in the papers, and inspire radio and television programming. And like many great talents, her troubled past is what motivates her to greatness. She has the amazing ability to emulate the talents of others.<br><br>Toshiko is also the mastermind behind a series of murders. The ultimate mimic, she has plagiarized, blackmailed, stolen and replicated the works of scores of talents. And now as her star is rising within the world of the elites and powerful she has amassed a long list of enemies frustrated by the fact that she has built critical and financial acclaim for nothing more than copying others' work. Neglected as a child, she is challenging the concepts of gender inequality while unleashing her loneliness upon the world as she climbs the social ladder one body at a time.<br><br>One of Osamu Tezuka's most wicked tales, The Book of Human Insects renders the 70's as a brutal and often polarizing bug-eat-bug world, where only those willing to sell their soul to the masses and become something less than human are capable of achieving their wildest dreams</p><p>Osamu Tezuka was born on November 3, 1928, in Osaka. He grew up in an open-minded family exposed to comics and Walt Disney. As a boy he also had a love for insects, which he would later as a grown-up incorporate into pen name. Having developed an intense understanding of the preciousness of life from his wartime experience, Osamu Tezuka aimed to become a physician and later earned his degree in medicine, but ultimately chose the profession he loved best: manga artist and animated film writer.<br><br>Tezuka's manga and animated films had a tremendous impact on the shaping of the psychology of Japan's postwar youth. His work changed the concept of Japanese comics, transforming it into an art form and incorporating a variety of new styles in creating the "story cartoon." Osamu Tezuka lived out his entire life tirelessly pursuing his efforts, passing away at the age of 60 on February 8, 1989. <br><br>In all, Tezuka produced more than 150,000 pages of graphic storytelling before his death. Posthumously Tezuka's work have won a number of awards in the U.S., including the 2009 Eisner Award given to his series Dororo.&#x201c;Brilliant. Just once, I&#x2019;d like to read a work by Tezuka that wasn&#x2019;t either at least nearly or totally perfectly crafted... A typical complaint nowadays is that the usual comic costs about $4 and takes about 10 minutes (or less) to read. But with Tezuka&#x2019;s work, you&#x2019;re invited to linger over a page for a minute, just taking everything in. One of Tezuka&#x2019;s (many) skills is his deftness with background details, with an emphasis on lived-in spaces that seem to have texture that you could just grip.&#x201d;&nbsp; <i>&#x2014;MTV Geek</i><br><br> &#x201c;I suppose just reading a story like that could be repugnant to some people, but I found it weirdly enjoyable. It&#x2019;s not like Tezuka sugarcoats his lead&#x2019;s fundamental awfulness, or blatantly asks that we enjoy it as she destroys people&#x2014;even in that &#x2018;hate the player/love the game&#x2019; way that you saw all over pop culture in the early 1970s. It&#x2019;s most fascinating to me as a big ol&#x2019; hate letter to the emerging Japanese post-war generation, although Tezuka includes a vile war-era criminal in the book as well.&#x201d;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>&#x2014;The Comics Reporter</i><br><br>"Epic Tezuka is back! As always, Tezuka builds long, winding plotlines and then brilliantly connects them to each other, creating a massive but memorable network of characters. This journey through the worlds of art, entertainment, crime, politics, and business also presents a deeper message about the dead ends and pitfalls of modern society. Tezuka&#x2019;s ambitions can also be seen in the art, where wild metaphors and images jump off the page" <i>-Anime News Network</i></p><h2>Atomic Accidents</h2><p><p><strong>A gripping narrative of nuclear mishaps and meltdowns around the globe, all of which have proven pivotal to the advancement of nuclear science.</strong></p><p>From the moment radiation was discovered in the late nineteenth century, nuclear science has had a rich history of innovative scientific exploration and discovery, coupled with mistakes, accidents, and downright disasters.<br><br> Mahaffey, a long-time advocate of continued nuclear research and nuclear energy, looks at each incident in turn and analyzes what happened and why, often discovering where scientists went wrong when analyzing past meltdowns.<br><br> Every incident has lead to new facets in understanding about the mighty atom&#x2015;and Mahaffey puts forth what the future should be for this final frontier of science that still holds so much promise.</p> 16 pages of color and B&amp;W images, charts and graphs throughout</p><p>James Mahaffey was a senior research scientist at the Georgia Tech Research Institute where he worked under contract for&nbsp;the Defense Nuclear Agency, the National Ground Intelligence Center,&nbsp;the Air Force Air Logistics Center, and Georgia Power Company. He is the author of Atomic Awakening&nbsp;and&nbsp;Atomic Accidents&nbsp;and&nbsp;lives in Atlanta, Georgia.Nuclear engineer Mahaffey&#x2019;s Atomic Awakening (2009) presented an engaging history of nuclear energy that came close to offering a ringing endorsement for its continued widespread use. Although his latest work focuses mostly on radioactivity&#x2019;s dark side, from its discovery in 1896 to its role in the recent Fukushima meltdown, Mahaffey nonetheless does argue persuasively that, by closely investigating its shortcomings, nuclear power can be made safer. Mahaffey begins with an episode of radiation poisoning that occurred in an Ozarks cave where hunters were exposed to radon gas, and offers a survey of nuclear weapons development, including the troubling disappearance of several H-bombs, before addressing history&#x2019;s most famous nuclear accidents. Entire chapters are devoted to dissecting what went wrong at Three Mile Island, Chernobyl, Fukushima, and Windscale, a lesser-known UK facility that burned uncontrollably for two days in 1957. While Mahaffey&#x2019;s subtext about nuclear power&#x2019;s overall safety likely won&#x2019;t sit well with the practice&#x2019;s many opponents, his abundant use of lively anecdotes and intriguing scientific tidbits makes this an educational page-turner. --Carl Hays</p><h2>There Was an Old Lady Who Swallowed a Bat!

He came up with the names and like any good parent he knocked them around to teach them life lessons. He bent them to see if they'd break, he dragged them behind cars by heavy metal chains, he exposed them to high temperatures for extended periods of time. Sometimes consonants broke off and left angry vowels on the laboratory tables. How else was he to know if they were ready for what the world had in store for them?<br><br>Those were good times. In the office they greeted each other with <i>Hey</i> and <i>Hey, man</i> and slapped each other on the back a lot. In the coffee room they threw the names around like weekenders tossing softballs. Clunker names fell with a thud on the ground. Hey, what do you think of this one? They brainstormed, bullshitted, performed assorted chicanery, and then sometimes they hit one out of the park. Sometimes they broke through to the other side and came up with something so spectacular and unexpected, so appropriate to the particular thing waiting that the others could only stand in awe. You joined the hall of legends.<br><br>It was the kind of business where there were a lot of Eureka stories. Much of the work went on in the subconscious level. He was making connections between things without thinking and then, <i>bam</i> on the subway scratching a nose, or <i>bam bam</i> while stubbing a toe on the curb. Floating in neon before him was the name. When the products flopped, he told himself it was because of the marketing people. It was the stupid public. The crap-ass thing itself. Never the name because what he did was perfect.<br><br>Sometimes he had to say the name even though he knew it was fucked up, just to hear how fucked up it was. Everyone had their off days. Sometimes it was contagious. The weather turned bad and they had to suffer through a month of suffixes. Rummaging through the stores down below, they hung the staple kickers on a word: they -ex'ed it, they -it'ed it, they stuck good ole -ol on it. They waited for the wind.<br><br>Sometimes he came up with a name that didn't fit the client but would one day be perfect for something else, and these he kept away from the world, reassuring them over the long years, his lovely homely daughters. When their princes arrived it was a glorious occasion. A good name did not dry up and get old. It waited for its intended.<br><br>They were good times. He was an expert in his field. Some might say a rose by any other name but he didn't go in for that kind of crap. That was crazy talk. Bad for business, bad for morale. A rose by any other name would wilt fast, smell like bitter almonds, God help you if the thorns broke the skin. He gave them the names and he saw the packages flying over the prescription counter, he saw the greedy hands grab them from the candy rack. He saw the names on the packaging printed over and over. Even when the gum wrappers were bunched up into little beetles of foil and skittered in the gutters, he saw the name printed on it and knew it was his. When they were hauled off to the garbage dump, the names blanched in the sun on the top of the heap and remained, even though what they named had been consumed. To have a name imprinted along the bottom of a Styrofoam container: this was immortality. He could see the seagulls swooping around in depressed circles. They could not eat it at all.<br>Roger Tipple did not have a weak chin so much as a very aggressive neck. When he answered Roger's phone call, it was the first thing he remembered. He had always imagined it as a simple allocation problem from back in the womb. After the wide plain of Roger's forehead and his portobello nose, there wasn't much left for the lower half of his face. Even Roger's lips were deprived; they were thin little worms that wiggled around the hole of his mouth. He thought, <i>Ridochi</i>n for the lantern-jawed. Easy enough, but at the moment he couldn't come up with what its opposite might be. He was concentrating on what Roger was saying. The assignment was strange.<br><br>He hadn't kept up with Roger since his misfortune, as he called it. He hadn't kept up with anyone from the office and for the most part, they hadn't kept up with him. Who could blame them really, after what happened. Occasionally someone reached out to him, and when they did he shied away, made noises about changing bandages. Eventually they gave up. He wasn't expecting the call. For a second he considered hanging up. If he'd planned it correctly, he would have been in a hermit cave in the mountains, two days' trek from civilization, or in a cabin on the shore of a polluted lake when Roger phoned. A place where you can get the right kind of thinking done for a convalescence after a misfortune. Instead, there he was in his apartment, and they just called him up.<br><br>He was watching an old black-and-white movie on the television, the kind of flick where nothing happened unless it happened to strings. Every facial twitch had its own score. Every smile ate up two and a half pages of sheet music. Every little thing walked around with this heavy freight of meaning. In his job, which was his past present and future job even though he had suffered a misfortune, he generally tried to make things more compact. Squeeze down the salient qualities into a convenient package. A smile was shorthand for a bunch of emotion. And here in this old movie they didn't trust that you would know the meaning of a smile so they had to get an orchestra. That's what he was thinking about when the phone rang: wasted rented tuxes.<br><br>He could almost see the green walls of the office as Roger spoke. Roger's door ajar and the phones on all the desks out there doing their little sonata. If a particular job was really successful the guys upstairs sent a bronze plaque to your office, with the client's name and your name engraved on it, and below that whatever name you had come up with. Roger had a lot of plaques, from before he became a manager, from when he was a hotshot. His former boss came into focus as he listened. He saw Roger tapping his pen, crossing out talking points and notes-to-self as he explained to him how this kind of job wasn't appropriate for the firm because of conflict of interest, and how the client had asked for a recommendation and he was top of the list. It wasn't appropriate for them but they'd take the finder's fee.<br><br>There was some token chitchat, too. He found out that Murck, the guy the next office over, his wife had had another baby that was just as ugly as Murck Senior. That kind of stuff, how the baseball team was doing this year. Roger got the chitchat out of the way and started to talk about the client. He had turned the sound off on the television but he could still figure out what was going on because a smile is a smile.<br><br>If Roger had called a week ago, he would have said no. He told Roger he'd do it, and when he put the phone down it came to him: <i>Chinplant</i>. Not his best work.<br>He was into names so they called him. He was available so he went. And he went far, he took a plane, grabbed a cab to the bus station, and hopped aboard a bus that took him out of the city. He pressed his nose up to the glass to see what there was to see. The best thing about the suburbs were the garages. God bless garages. The husbands bought do-it-yourself kits from infomercials, maybe the kits had names like <i>Fixit</i> or <i>Handy Hal Your Hardware Pal</i>, and the guys built shelves in the garage and on the shelves they put products, like cans of water-repellent leather treatment called <i>Aquaway</i> and boxes of nails called <i>Carter's Fine Points</i> and something called <i>Lawnlasting</i> that will prevent droopy blades. Shelves and shelves of all that glorious stuff. He loved supermarkets. In supermarkets, all the names were crammed into their little seats, on top of each other, awaiting their final destinations.<br><br>The ride was another hour and a half but he didn't mind. He thought about his retainer, which he had deposited that morning. It occurred to him that it was an out-of-state check and would take a few days to clear. Through the window he watched elephants stampede across the sky. As soon as he stepped out of the airport he knew it was going to rain because his foot was throbbing, and now the clouds pursued the bus on an intercept course. They finally caught up when he arrived in the town. The bus kneeled at the curb, he stepped out, and felt the first few fat drops of rain. It rained most of the time he was there, as if the clouds were reluctant to leave after racing all that way to catch him. No one else got off.<br><br>The town square was a tiny park boxed by three streets and on the final side by the slow muddy river. A neat little main drag, he thought. It was clear that they were putting some money into it. The red brick bordering the park was recently laid, obviously set down in the last year or two, and there were holes in the ground surrounded by plastic orange fencing where they were adding the next new improvement or other. All the grass in the park was impossibly level. For community service drunk drivers probably knelt with scissors.<br><br>People sprinted away from the benches to get out of the rain. They ran into doorways, hid beneath the awnings and overhangs of the stores lining the square. A lot of the stores seemed, like him, new arrivals. The same national brands found all over. They were new on the first floor, at any rate--on the second and third stories of the buildings, the original details were preserved, the old-timey shutters and eaves. He imagined crazy aunts in leg irons behind the tiny attic windows of stained glass. In between the new stores, the remaining old establishments hung in there like weeds, with their faded signs and antiquated lures. Dead flies littered the bottom of the ancient window displays, out of reach of arthritic hands.<br><br>There was this old white guy in a purple plaid sweater vest who didn't care about the rain. The old guy was walking his dog and taking measured little steps, taking in the activity of the street. He took him for that brand of retiree who becomes a night watchman of the afternoons, patrolling the grounds, scribbling down the license plate numbers of suspicious vehicles. His dog didn't care about the rain, either. It was one of those tiny dogs that had a fancy foreign name that assured you it was quality merchandise. As he talked to the old guy, the dog stood a few feet away and sniffed at a promising stain.<br><br>He asked him if he knew where he could find the Hotel Winthrop.<br><br>The guy looked at him through the droplets on his bifocals and said, "You're in it, son."<br><br>"I know I'm in Winthrop," he said, "I'm looking for the Hotel Winthrop." He extended the piece of paper in his hand. "Number 12 Winthrop Street."<br><br>The old guy raised the dog leash and pointed across the park and that's when it really started raining.<br>He said to himself: Bottle a certain musty essence and call it <i>Old Venerable</i>. Spray it around the house and your humble abode might smell like the Winthrop Suite of the Hotel Winthrop. The man at registration had told him that President So-and-so had slept there, one of those presidents that nobody has ever heard of, or everybody always forgot was a president at some point. Board of Ed types were always a bit dismayed when they needed to name a new high school and realized that all the favorite workhorses were taken, and were forced down the list to the sundry Pierces and Fillmores. As he looked around the room, he had to admit that it was quite possible that one of those so-and-so presidents had stayed there, after a listless stump speech. It was a good place to make a bad decision, and in particular, a bad decision that would affect a great many people. Considering the nature of his assignment, his quarters were appropriate.<br><br>The people of bygone days had pulled dark wood in wagons to panel the hotel walls, and now it was scraped and splitting. They had ordered red-and-orange carpet from the big city catalogs and laid it on the floor for a hundred years of feet, and now it was gauze. The armchairs, tables, and writing desk had been moved so often that the furniture legs had scraped fuzzy white halos into the floor. If he put the three lamps together, he could partially reconstruct the sylvan idyll described on their round bodies--alone, they were too chipped and defaced to relate anything more than ruin. Brittle brown spots mottled the lamp shades where the bulbs had smoldered, mishap after mishap. The previous guests had left their mark. The only thing unscathed through these accumulated misadventures was a painting that hung on one wall. Closer inspection revealed it to be a portrait of one of the Winthrop elders. Winthrop stood in a field with some hunting dogs, preserved in his kingdom. Guests came and went, guests registered, retired, and checked out, but this man remained. He never blinked.<br><br>He was relieved that it was not one of those eyes-follow-you paintings. He had recently weaned himself off Drowsatin and didn't want to go back to using it again.<br><br>The clients had left some things for him on the wooden desk. Mayor Goode had sent up a bottle of port, Mr. Winthrop had sent him a local history written by a town librarian. Writing your town's local history was the librarian version of climbing Everest, he figured. And Mr. Aberdeen had faxed him a welcome to their fine community, informing him that he and the mayor would meet him in the hotel bar at six o'clock. There was nothing among those things to tell him that they had agreed to his very specific conditions of employment. He frowned and looked over the room once more. He wasn't even sure if he should unpack. The coat hangers were handcuffed to the closet, as if they had been warned in advance of some rumored compulsion of his.</p><h2>Revelations: Visions, Prophecy, and Politics in the Book of Revelation</h2><p><b>A profound exploration of the Bible's most controversial book&#x2014;from the author of <i>Beyond Belief</i> and <i>The Gnostic Gospels</i></b><p></p><p>The strangest book of the New Testament, filled with visions of the Rapture, the whore of Babylon, and apocalyptic writing of the end of times, the Book of Revelation has fascinated readers for more than two thousand years, but where did it come from? And what are the meanings of its surreal images of dragons, monsters, angels, and cosmic war?</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elaine Pagels, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author and "the preeminent voice of biblical scholarship to the American public" (<i>The Philadelphia Inquirer</i>), elucidates the true history of this controversial book, uncovering its origins and the roots of dissent, violence, and division in the world's religions. Brilliantly weaving scholarship with a deep understanding of the human needs to which religion speaks, Pagels has written what may be the masterwork of her unique career.</p><p><b>Elaine Pagels</b> is the Harrington Spear Paine Professor of Religion at Princeton University and the author of <i>Reading Judas, The Gnostic Gospels</i>-winner of the National Book Critics Circle Award and the National Book Award- and the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>Beyond Belief</i>.

One of [Elaine Pagels's] great gifts is much in abundance: her ability to ask, and answer, the plainest questions about her material without speaking down to her audience . . . She must be a fiendishly good lecturer."<br> &#x2014; <b><i>The New York Times</i></b><br><br>"One of the significant benefits of Pagels's book is its demonstration of the unpredictability of apocalyptic politics . . . The meaning of the Apocalypse is ever malleable and ready to hand for whatever crisis one confronts. That is one lesson of Pagels's book. Another is that we all should be vigilant to keep some of us from using the vision for violence against others."<br> &#x2014; <b><i>The New York Times Book Review</i> (Editors' Choice)</b><br><br>"Pagels is an absorbing, intelligent, and eye-opening companion. Calming and broad-minded here, as in her earlier works, she applies a sympathetic and humane eye to texts that are neither subtle nor sympathetically humane but lit instead by fury." &#x2014; <b>Adam Gopnik, <i>The New Yorker</i></b><br><br>"Any book in the Bible that can be cited simultaneously by deeply conservative end-of-times Christians who see the Apocalypse around the corner and by Marxist-friendly Christians looking forward to justice at the End of History must have a compelling back story. That back story is told well and concisely by Elaine Pagels in her new book, <i>Revelations</i>." &#x2014; <b><i>The Boston Globe</i></b></p><h2>Juice Guru: Transform Your Life by Adding One Juice a Day</h2><p><p> This book illustrates and explains how just one, well-timed, fresh juice a day can transform health.

Sketches need to transfer information and interpret complex information into definable chunks or messages. How they are visualized depends as much on personal aesthetics as on experience.<br> The rule of thumb is to develop sketches in a straightforward manner while allowing them to be expressive. A few years ago, a Carnegie Mellon design student named Anna Carey coined the term &#x201c;freshture&#x201d; in the context of a first-year drawing class. Her insightful, pithy term seemed to sum up the qualities of good sketches the class was describing&#x2014;fresh and gestural.&nbsp;<i>Freshness</i>&nbsp;or crisp qualities to strokes, so that they look like they are held in tension, make sketches appear more kinetic. Letting&nbsp;<i>gesture</i>&nbsp;influence mark-making by purposefully missing outlines and overdrawing in key areas adds another quality. Said another way, good sketches are accurate and precise in structure and message but rough in an expressive way. This approach allows some flexibility in the reading of the sketch and takes the formality and rigid qualities away to make the drawing more visually accessible. Keeping &#x201c;freshture&#x201d; in mind may help to ensure that a sketch reads clearly as a sketch and is not misinterpreted as a final drawing or concrete idea.</p><h2>Evidence of Things Unseen: A Novel</h2><p>This poetic novel, by the acclaimed author of John Dollar, describes America at the brink of the Atomic Age.

He and fifteen other sons from Dare County had been among the first recruits to go across the North Atlantic in '18 for valor, decency, and hell like they'd never known. Not one among them who survived was proud of it in any way that didn't cast a shadow back across his pride. Fos himself, by accident, had been a sparker in the field, an incendiary artist, and he'd been brilliant at it. He'd always had an interest in what made things light up, made things radiate, but he never knew he had a latent genius like a fuse, a flare for fireworks, until they handed him a uniform and stood him up in front of a regimental officer and asked him what, if anything, he was good at doing. I'm good at making things light up, Fos said. Looking at the open file on the camp table between them, Fos watched the R.O.'s pen stall where Fos's name was written on the page. You mean explosives? the R.O. said.<br><br> -- um no sir.<br><br>The pen still stalled.<br><br> -- chemicals? the R.O. pressed.<br><br> -- <i>radiance,</i> Fos explained.<br><br>They put him in Artillery and shipped him over with the rest of the First Army and on the fifth day in their training camp in France two British officers with more brass than a church organ between them in-terrupted gun assembly in his barracks. Who's the chap here who's the chemist? the one with more brass asked. When no one volunteered, the one with less brass held his clipboard up and read out, Private First Class Foster? Fos felt the heat rise to his cheeks and took a weak step forward.<br><br> -- that would be me, sir.<br><br>Come with us.<br><br>They led Fos past rows of wooden barracks to the quartermaster's depot into the munition stores. Next to a stepped-temple of stacked diesel drums there was a brick hut with a flat roof, buttressed by sandbags. Inside there were four men in blue smocks and gauze surgical masks in a makeshift laboratory. An astringent tinge of sulfur in the air was the first thing that Fos noticed. Speak any French? the British officer asked before he left him there.<br><br> -- no sir.<br><br> -- learn to.<br><br> -- yes sir.<br><br>Four pairs of dark wide eyes stared at Fos above the surgical masks. Then one of the men, the short one in the foreground, spoke. A patch of moisture appeared on his mask from where the words emanated and Fos stared at it, uncomprehending, as if a translation would materialize there as well. The tallest of the four untied his own mask and, with a heavy accent, said, He wants to know are you the candlemaker Uncle Sam has sent?<br><br> -- <i>candlemaker?</i><br><br>Fos stared at the material around them. There were shelves of chemicals in jars, sieves and grinders, meshes, funnels, fuses of all sorts, crates of French F 1 pineapple grenade casings. As best as Fos could reckon from the things that he could recognize, the men in the blue smocks were making firecrackers. The short man gave an impatient shrug and seemed to ask the same question again, only this time with more force so his mask made little jumps, in and out, like a pumping artery. Fos nodded, mutely, and then there were <i>oos</i> and <i>ahs</i> all around and then the short one asked him something else in a nicer way with what appeared to be a little curtsy. He wants to know where in the United States we come from? the tall man translated for Fos.<br><br>Oh, Fos answered. North Carolina.<br><br>They stared at him.<br><br>Kitty Hawk, he said.<br><br> -- <i>kiti</i> -- ? the short one repeated.<br><br>Kitty <i>Hawk,</i> Fos emphasized. He flapped his arms. <i>The Wright brothers,</i> he said.<br><br>There was a burst of recognition as all of them flapped their arms and chimed Or-<i>vee!</i> Wil-<i>bear!</i> That established, everyone turned back to what he had been doing and left Fos in the care of the tallest one among them, the one who spoke the English, a French-Canadian, as it turned out, who handed Fos a mask and smock and began to show him around the little laboratory.<br><br><i>You wouldn't think it,</i> Fos would later tell his son Lightfoot, <i>but the worst of problems over there was Light, pure and simple.</i> Daylight. 'Cause there wasn't hardly ever any of it. Almost none. You would have thought the vermin and the brute of noise would have been the worst, but men go crazy without daylight. In the smoke and in the dark. Men go crazy when they have to run out into somethin that might kill them that they can't see right in front of 'em.<br><br>So Fos's first job in the Great War was to learn from four Frenchmen, who'd had three years' more experience, how to light the trenches, how to light the field. So that the boys could see what they were shooting at. See death coming, when it came.<br><br><i>Sodium nitrate, Lead tetraoxide, Potassium chlorate,</i> the Canadian recited to Fos from the labels on the bottles on the shelves. Oxidizers, he explained. Hot. <i>Vurry</i> hot, he emphasized. Then he pointed to another group of chemicals and read, <i>Charcoal, Lampblack, Titanium</i> and told Fos, Make the <i>boum.</i> You understand? Fos nodded. All the labels, except the ones for casings and the fuses, were printed in English -- all the warnings were, too -- and Fos comprehended that all these chemicals must have been delivered from the States, or from England. Somewhere where the native lingo produced disclaimers written in English that warned FLAMMABLE SOLID. SPONTANEOUSLY COMBUSTIBLE. DANGEROUS WHEN WET. The Canadian took down a jar and shook out a salting of powder on a glass slide and said, Paris <i>green.</i> Is copper. Makes the fire burn in blue. Blue flare.<br><br>Behind them, one of the Frenchmen nodded over his work and translated, <i>La flamb�e.</i><br><br> -- <i>la fus�e,</i> another said.<br><br> -- <i>la flamme vacillante,</i> and Fos was reminded of a drawing he'd once seen of medieval monks at their tables, brushing color onto pages of gospels, while chanting.<br><br><i>Barium chloride,</i> the Canadian told him. For the green flame. <i>Barium sulphate. </i>All the bariums, green. <i>Sulfur</i> -- yellow. For white, pure white flare -- the magnesiums. <i>Vurry explosif!</i><br>rd<br><br> -- <i>foum!</i> one of the Frenchmen mimed.<br><br> -- ker-<i>plouie!</i> another one joked.<br><br>But Fos was transfixed by something else. He wasn't a chemist. He wasn't transported by processes that needed to burn oxygen. He wasn't interested in energy that <i>burned</i>. One of the Frenchmen at a small desk at the back of the lab had a glass vial and a paintbrush in his hands and he was painting a sign on a sheet of metal with a liquid that appeared to be water.<br><br>But in the dark, Fos knew, that liquid would <i>glow.</i><br><br> -- rah-<i>dyoom,</i> the Canadian said.<br><br>I <i>know,</i> uttered Fos.<br><br>He was impressed.<br><br>A gram of radium these days, he reckoned, must cost a fortune. Tens of thousands of dollars.<br><br> -- <i>caviar,</i> Fos said, searching his English for some way to express to the Frenchman that he knew the stuff's value.<br><br>Above his mask, the Frenchman's eyebrows went up and he pulled his fingertips together and gestured at his mouth and said, <i>Mais il faut qu'on ne le mange pas!</i><br><br> -- he says Don't eat it, the Canadian said.<br><br> -- <i>don't worry!</i> said Fos. He knew about radium, about radium's effects on humans. Ever since he'd first seen the light that nature can make without burning air, seen his first vision of bioluminescent plankton in the waters off the Outer Banks, Fos had been fascinated by the kinds of lights nature can produce, the ones not always visible to man, the range of lights radiating just off the edge of human vision at the boundaries of the human spectrum. Infrareds and ultraviolets. Colors only birds can see, in their mating rituals, in the feathers of prospective mates. Or colors only underwater animals can see in the ocean's depth beneath the reach of solar light. x-rays, for example. x-rays fascinated Fos. First time he saw an x-ray image in a magazine when he was still a boy, it captured his attention, totally. He stared at it the way a person stares into an icon during prayer. It was an x-ray of a human leg. You could tell it was a left leg from the way the foot bones were arranged. There was something ghostly in them, Fos thought -- in the bones. There was something spectral in the picture. As if the image, in and of itself, possessed a soul. Or captured one. He tore it out and carried it inside his billfold, kept it hidden in his pocket for luck, for prayer, for the same reason someone else would keep a rabbit's foot. Subsequently, he made a point of reading everything he could about the subject -- how x-rays are made, how they'd been discovered, who invented the photographic process of fixing them to film. When he was only twelve he wrote off to one Dr. George Johnson of Boston, President of the American Roentgen Ray Society, to inquire how he could become a member of their august scientific circle. Roentgen, for whom the Society had been named, had "discovered" rays emanating from a cathode-ray tube in 1895, five years after Fos was born. One year after that the Frenchman Becquerel noticed energetic radiation emanating from a uranium salt when they'd fogged a photographic plate that he'd placed next to it by accident. Two years later Pierre and Marie Curie discovered radium -- a new element -- in uranium ore. The radium, itself, owned the capacity to <i>glow.</i> Soon after the Curies' discovery, Becquerel went to visit them at their Paris laboratory and asked if he could take a sample of their new element home with him for experiment. They gave him a phial of liquid radium which Becquerel placed in his waistcoat pocket next to his pocket watch. By the time he undressed that night, six hours later, the radium had burned an outline of the phial onto the surface of his skin through three layers of clothing and had irradiated the numbers on his pocket watch so he could read them in the dark. In other words: they glowed.<br><br>Soon before he joined up to go to War, Fos had read that a watch factory in Salem, North Carolina, had closed down because a dozen factory workers, watchface painters, had developed a mysterious bone disease, necrosis of the jawbone, and subsequently died. What the article in the local paper hadn't said was why only the painters at the watch factory had fallen ill. But Fos had guessed the reason. Working on a field that small, painting lines the livelong day on a circle half the size of a silver dollar, the watch painters had a built-in opportunity to attract hazard to their bones, especially if the paint contained pure radium. No doubt for precision and to perfect their points, every quarter hour -- maybe even every minute-on-the-minute -- the painters must have licked their brushes. So Fos understood the culinary subtleties the Frenchman had referred to when he said, Don't eat it. Fos was never one for insubordination but the truth was until he saw the radium he'd been thinking he should come clean to the Canadian and tell him to tell the Frenchmen that there'd been a regimental error and they'd recruited the wrong guy. It would have been a stupid thing to do, Fos knew. Even in so short a time as he'd been in France he'd heard the horror stories about what they could expect once they moved into the frontline trenches. At least if he played along here with the Frenchies he might reasonably expect to stay <i>behind</i> the front. When he thought about it he knew he was better off making flares and staying under cover than strapping his gas mask on, arming His Trusty with its bayonet and hurling his entirety against sure desolation, land mines, and the unknown of that hell between the trenches they called No mans land. Still, until he saw the radium Fos wasn't keen on simply playing out his Army time setting loose a load of chemistry into French heaven. But when he saw the radium he knew at once there was before him something he had dreamed of: Chance of a lifetime. It wasn't the last time nature's active miracles would offer Fos A Chance, but they weren't always as self-evident as that one was. That one was a beaut -- the first step in a chain reaction of events that soon had Fos sharing a cramped space dubbed the Boom Bunker in the trenches on the American Line southwest of Verdun outside the town of St. Mihiel with an intense fella from Tennessee they called "Flash" Handy who would ultimately change Fos's life. Flash was the regimental photographer and he and Fos were the only boys -- other than the mustard gas and chlorine boys in the Chem Corps -- who were supplied with active chemicals on the front line. Fos had all the oxidizers, neons, burn reducers, phosphorescents, and fluorescents he needed to create a Light at the end of every tunnel for the doughboys in their darkest hours: Flash had the acid baths, developers, gum-bichromates and platinum and silver powders for his photographs. If the Jerries had ever landed a live one on them Flash and Fos had enough volatility in store to take the whole American Expeditionary Force one way to the moon. Fos, himself, took a nasty dose of mustard gas on the September morning the First Army made their raid on St. Mihiel, and after that his eyes watered continuously. He couldn't see without his specs in daylight, but his night vision stayed the same as it had always been -- and it had always been near superhuman. It was legendary, all the things that Fos could see that others couldn't in the dark. Which meant that not only was he indispensible on night maneuvers in the field but he was also an enlightened wizard in the darkroom -- a fact which Flash was quick to grasp. Fos could make a photographic print with such resulting subtle nuance and precision it seemed the image that emerged onto the photographic paper had been bled from Fos's hands. When the armistice was called on November 11, Flash's unit was dispatched to Rouen for the Occupation, while Fos's went to Metz, and the two of them were forced to go their separate ways. But when Fos returned to Kitty Hawk in the late winter of '19, Flash offered him a partnership in his studio in Knoxville, Tennessee. Fos packed his x-ray books and tide charts into his Army footlocker and drove his old Ford truck away from the Atlantic Coast on the hottest August morning of that year on record. For as long as anyone could remember, Fos's people had been lightermen in and around the shoals and hoaxing sands of the Outer Banks -- conveyancers of cargo in scoop-hulled longboats called <i>lighters</i> in those waters -- until the family tree had pruned down to a single shoot, Fos, like a pot-bound exotic in an orangerie too strenuously pollarded. Tidal salts ran in his blood. As he drove away that blistering morning and the land fell off behind him in the first swell of its Continental self, Fos felt a tightness in his chest and his eyes began to water. Well his eyes were always watering, fogging up his glasses. Blister gas, the boys had called the mustard, because that's what it did. You couldn't see it coming and it...</p><h2>Songs of the Humpback Whale: A Novel (Wsp Readers Club)</h2><p><b>Jodi Picoult&#x2019;s powerful novel portrays an emotionally charged marriage that changes course in one explosive moment.</b><br><br><i>Sometimes finding your own voice<br> is a matter of listening to the heart...</i><br> <br>Jodi Picoult's powerful novel portrays an emotionally charged marriage that changes course in one explosive moment....For years, Jane Jones has lived in the shadow of her husband, renowned San Diego oceanographer Oliver Jones.

My parents came into the room and put their arms around me; they patted my head and smoothed my hair, fine, and I still couldn't stop screaming. Even with my mouth closed, I continued -- the high, shrill note of a nocturnal animal.<br><br>My parents were beside themselves. We lived in a button-down suburb of Boston, and we were waking up the neighbors one by one. I watched the lights come on in different houses -- blue and yellow, blinking like Christmas -- and wondered what was happening to me.<br><br>This wasn't a common occurrence. I was barely nineteen, a straight-A student fresh out of Wellesley College and in 1976 that was still an accomplishment. I was marrying the man of my dreams in a prototypical white clapboard New England church, and the reception -- a lavish one with white-gloved waiters and Beluga caviar -- was going to be held in my parents' backyard. I had a job waiting for me when I returned from my honeymoon. There was no foreseeable problem that I could articulate.<br><br>To this day, I don't know why that happened to me. As mysteriously as it all started, the screaming went away and the next morning I married Oliver Jones -- <i>the</i> Oliver Jones -- and we just about lived happily ever after.<br><br>I am the only speech pathologist in this town, which means I get shuttled back and forth to different elementary schools in the San Diego suburbs. It's not such a big deal now that Rebecca is old enough to take care of herself, and since Oliver is away so much of the time, I have less to do at home. I enjoy my work but certainly not the way Oliver enjoys his work. Oliver would be content to live in a sailcloth tent on the coast of Argentina, watching his whales sound in warm water.<br><br>My job is to help children find their voices -- kinds that come to school mute, or with lisps or cleft palates. At first, they come into my little makeshift classroom one at a time and they shuffle their Keds on the floor and shyly glance at the formidable recording equipment and they are absolutely silent. Sometimes I stay silent too, until the student breaks the ice and asks what he or she is supposed to do. Some students cover their mouths with their hands at this point; I have even seen one little girl cry: they cannot stand to hear their own voices, pieces of themselves that they have been told are ugly. My role is to show them there's someone who is ready to listen to what they have to say and the way they have to say it.<br><br>When I was seven, I tell these kids, I used to whistle every time I said the letter S. In school I got teased and because of this I did not have many friends and I did not talk very much. One day my teacher told the class we'd be putting on a play and that everyone had to participate. I was so nervous about reading aloud in front of everyone else that I pretended I was sick. I faked a fever by holding the thermometer up to a light bulb when my mother left the room. I was allowed to stay home for three days, until my teacher called, and my mother figured out what I was doing. When I went back to school, my teacher called me aside. All of the parts had been taken in the play, she said, but she had saved a special role for me, offstage. I was going to be the Manager of Sound Effects, just like in the movies. I practiced with my teacher every day after school for three weeks. In time I discovered I could become a fire engine, a bird, a mouse, a bee, and many other things because of my lisp. When the night of the play came, I was given a black robe and a microphone. The other students got to be just one part, but I became the voice of several animals and machines. And my father was so proud of me; it was the only time I remember him telling me so.<br><br>That's the story I give at those Coastal Studies cocktail parties Oliver and I go to. We rub shoulders with people who'll give grant money. We introduce ourselves as Dr. and Dr. Jones, although I'm still ABD. We sneak out when everyone is going to sit down to the main course, and we run to the car and make fun of people's sequined dresses and dinner jackets. Inside, I curl up against Oliver as he drives, and I listen to him tell me stories I have heard a million times before -- about an era when you could spot whales in every ocean.<br><br>In spite of it all, there's just <i>something</i> about Oliver. You know what I'm talking about -- he was the first man who truly took my breath away, and sometimes he still can. He's the one person I feel comfortable enough with to share a home, a life, a child. He can take me back fifteen years with a smile. In spite of differences, Oliver and I have Oliver and I.<br><br>In this one school where I spend Tuesdays, my office is a janitorial closet. Sometime after noon the secretary of the school knocks on the door and tells me Dr. Jones is on the phone. Now this is truly a surprise. Oliver is at home this week, putting together some research, but he usually has neither the time nor the inclination to call me. He never asks what school I head to on a given day. "Tell him I'm with a student," I say, and I push the play button on my tape recorder. Vowel sounds fill the room: <i>AAAAA EEEEEIIIII.</i> I know Oliver too well to play his games. <i>OOOOO UUUUU.</i> Oh, you. Oh, you.<br><br>Oliver is Very Famous. He wasn't when we met, but today he is one of the leading researchers of whales and whale behavior. He has made discoveries that have rocked the scientific world. He is so well known that people take pictures of our mailbox, as if to say, "I've been to the place where Dr. Jones lives." Oliver's most important research has been on whale songs. It appears that whole groupings of whales sing the same ones -- Oliver has recorded this -- and pass the songs down over generations. I don't understand much about his work, but that is just as much my fault as Oliver's. He never tells me about the ideas burning in his mind anymore, and I sometimes forget to ask.<br><br>Naturally Oliver's career has come first. He moved us to California to take a job with the San Diego Center for Coastal Studies, only to find out East Coast humpbacks were his true passion. The minute I got to San Diego I wanted to leave, but I didn't tell Oliver that. For better or for worse, I had said. Oliver got to fly back to Boston and I stayed here with an infant, in a climate that is always summer, that never smells like snow.<br><br>I'm not taking his phone call.<br><br>I'm not taking this again, period.<br><br>It is one thing for me to play second fiddle; it is another thing to see it happen to Rebecca. At fourteen she has the ability to take a survey of her life from a higher vantage point -- an ability I haven't mastered at thirty-five -- and I do not believe she likes what she is seeing. When Oliver is home, which is rare, he spends more time in his study than with us. He doesn't take an interest in anything that isn't tied to the seas. The way he treats me is one matter: we have a history; I hold myself accountable for falling in love in the first place. But Rebecca will not take him on faith, just because he is her father. Rebecca expects.<br><br>I've heard about teenagers who run away, or get pregnant or drop out of school, and I have heard these things linked to problems at home. So I offered Oliver an ultimatum. Rebecca's fifteenth birthday next week coincides with Oliver's planned visit to a humpback breeding ground off the coast of South America. Oliver intends to go. I told him to be here.<br><br>What I wanted to say is: This is your daughter. Even if we have grown so far apart that we don't recognize each other when we pass, we have this life, this block of time, and what do you think about that?<br><br>One reason I keep my mouth shut is Rebecca's accident. It was the result of a fight with Oliver, and I've been doing my best to keep something like that from happening again. I don't remember what that argument was about, but I gave him a piece of my mind and he hit me. I picked up my baby (Rebecca was three and a half at the time) and flew to my parents. I told my mother I was going to divorce Oliver; he was a lunatic and on top of this he'd hit me. Oliver called and said he didn't care what I did but I had no right to keep his daughter. He threatened legal action. So I took Rebecca to the airport and told her, "I'm sorry, honey, but I can't stand that man." I bribed a stewardess with a hundred dollars to take her on the plane, and it crashed in Des Moines. The next thing I knew I was standing in a farmer's cornfield, watching the wreckage smoke. It still seemed to be moving. The wind sang through the plane's limbs, voices I couldn't place. And behind me was Rebecca, singed but intact, one of five survivors, curled in her father's arms. She has Oliver's yellow hair and freckles. Like him, she's beautiful. Oliver and I looked at each other and I knew right then why fate had made me fall in love with a man like Oliver Jones: some combination of him and of me had created a child who could charm even unyielding earth.<br><br>Copyright � 1992 by Jodi Picoult</p><h2>Merry-Go-Round: A Book About Nouns (Explore!)</h2><p><b>Perfect for introductory grammar lessons!</b>&nbsp;<b>What is a noun?</b><br>&nbsp;<br><b>Explore language</b>&nbsp;and discover the uses of nouns and their many grammatical forms from proper nouns to common nouns to abstract nouns.<br>&nbsp;<br><i>&#x201c;Heller explores types of nouns: common, proper, abstract, concrete, compound, collective, singular, plural, and possessive...

Plants that Never Ever Bloom: A Book About Fungi, Ferns, and Other Plants Without Flowers</p><p>After receiving a fine arts degree from the University of California at Berkeley and completing two years of graduate work in design at the California College of Arts and Crafts in Oakland, <b>Ruth Heller</b> (1923-2004) began her career designing wrapping paper, cocktail napkins, greeting cards, and coloring books. After five years of rejection and one complete revision, Heller's first book,&nbsp;<i>Chickens Aren't the Only Ones</i>, about egg-laying animals, was published in 1981. It was so successful that the sequel, and second book to be published,&nbsp;<i>Animals Born Alive And Well</i>&nbsp;(1982), about mammals, quickly followed. In 1983 and 1984, her third and fourth titles,&nbsp;<i>The Reason For A Flower</i>&nbsp;(about plants that have seeds and flowers) and&nbsp;<i>Plants That Never Ever Bloom</i>&nbsp;(about plants that do not) were published.<br><br>She then began work on a collection of six books, the&nbsp;<i>How To Hide</i>&nbsp;series on camouflage and the magic of this phenomenon in nature, which covered the entire animal kingdom -- insects, birds, mammals, amphibians, reptiles, and sea creatures. The next collection of books became a five-volume series on parts of speech:&nbsp;<i>A Cache of Jewels and Other Collective Nouns; Kites Sail High: A Book About Verbs; Many Luscious Lollipops: A Book About Adjectives; Merry-Go-Round: A Book About Nouns;</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Up, Up and Away: A Book About Adverbs</i>. She also wrote and illustrated the unique and fascinating book&nbsp;<i>Color</i>, a charming and instructive guide to how art goes through the four color printing process.<br><br>Among the notable people who have had an influence on Heller's writing have been: Ogden Nash, Gilbert and Sullivan, Edward Lear, Hilaire Belloc, and Dr. Seuss. Heller says of her work, "All my books are nonfiction picture books in rhyme. I find writing in rhyme enjoyable and challenging, and I think it is an easy way for children to learn new facts and acquire a sophisticated vocabulary. Children are not intimidated by big words. I try to make my writing succinct and allow the illustrations to convey as much information as possible."Kindergarten-Grade 6-- Nouns of all kinds are the subject of Heller's latest in her series of books on parts of speech. Common, proper, abstract, concrete, compound, and collective nouns are all defined and shown by example in usually lilting verse. Singular, plural, and possessive forms of nouns are also thoroughly covered, and determiners are explained and demonstrated. The rhyme form is used with amazing skill but now and then seems forced as in, "Nouns are highly effective./ The last kind of NOUN is . . . COLLECTIVE." How and why they work are not explained. Striking graphic design with large clear objects in bold colors overflowing each double-page spread make the book a visual treat. The use of bold type for all the nouns is particularly pleasing and will make for easy reading aloud. Heller's language books challenge users' creativity since the concepts are difficult for the picture-book format. Conversely, the verse and illustrations can delight very young children while older readers are sure to find the concise definitions clearer and certainly more entertaining than any grammar text. Those who have found the others in the series successful will want this one. --Louise L. Sherman, Anna C.

I read Gardens of the Moon with great pleasure. And now that I have read it, I would be hard pressed to decide what I enjoyed more: the richly and ominously magical world of Malaz and Genabackis; the large cast of sympathetically-rendered characters; or the way the story accumulates to a climax that hits like machinegun fire. My advice to anyone who might listen to me is, Treat yourself to Gardens of the Moon. And my entirely selfish advice to Steven Erikson is, write faster."--Stephen R. Donaldson<br><br>"An astounding debut . . . has the potential to become known as a defining work in Fantasy." --SF Site<br><br>"I stand slack-jawed in awe of The Malazan Book of the Fallen. This masterwork of imagination may be the high water mark of epic fantasy---accomplished with none of the customary rifs on Tolkien. This marathon of ambition has a depth and breadth and sense of vast reaches of inimical time unlike anything else available today. The Black Company, Zelazny's Amber, Vance's Dying Earth, and other mighty drumbeats are but foreshadowings of this dark dragon's hoard."--Glen Cook<br><br>"Complex, challenging...Erikson's strengths are his grown-up characters and his ability to create a world every bit as intricate and messy as our own."--J.

The Malazan empire simmers with discontent, bled dry by interminable warfare, infighting and bloody confrontations with Anomander Rake, Lord of Moon&#x2019;s Spawn, and his Tiste Andii.

For Sergeant Whiskeyjack and his squad of Bridgeburners, and for Tattersail, surviving sorceress of the Second Legion, the aftermath of the siege of Pale should have been a time to pause, to mourn the many dead. But the imperial gaze has fallen upon the ancient citadel of Darujhistan. This, the last of the Free Cities of Genabackis, yet dares to hold out. However, the empire is not alone in this great game.

Leckie enlisted in the United States Marine Corps on the day following the attack on Pearl Harbor, going on to serve as a machine gunner<i>&nbsp;</i>and as an intelligence scout and participating in all 1st Marine Division campaigns except<i>&nbsp;</i>Okinawa.&nbsp;He was awarded five battle stars, the Naval Commendation<i>&nbsp;</i>Medal with Combat V, and the Purple Heart. <i>Helmet for My Pillow</i>&nbsp;was his first book; it received the USMC<i>&nbsp;</i>Combat Correspondents Association Award upon publication.Larger in both number of troops and tonnage than the Normandy landing, the battle for Okinawa, April 1-June 21, 1945, was the last great campaign of WWII. Leckie here recreates the events, from the planning by American fleet admirals in a suite at San Francisco's St. Francis Hotel to the ritual suicide of Lt. Gen. Mitsuri Ushijima on a cliff overlooking the Pacific the day the Americans declared victory. Much of the succinct, fast-paced narrative deals with how the Army and Marine divisions cooperated as they applied the "corkscrew and blowtorch" methods necessary to dislodge the tenacious defenders of an island only 375 miles from their Japanese homeland. In a thought-provoking final section, Leckie discusses the still simmering questions of whether the dropping of the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki compelled the Japanese to surrender, whether they would soon have surrendered anyway and whether the Okinawa campaign was in fact unnecessary. Leckie, a prolific author of popular military books, writes stirring prose; his fans will not be disappointed by this one.

Based on extensive research and personal experience with the last working Shaker community in Maine, this book traces the roots of Shaker design to Shaker belief, which inspired the clean lines, careful craftsmanship, and signature details that define the style. The author also discusses the less known Victorian period of Shaker design and shows how this style has influenced subsequent ones. A bibliography, glossary, and index are included.</p><p>Many appreciate the clean, simple lines of traditional Shaker furniture, yet few know the people behind the designs or the spiritual beliefs that play such an integral part in both their work and daily lives. In his book, <i>The Shaker Legacy: Perspectives on an Enduring Furniture Style</i>, author Christian Becksvoort, a contributing editor of <i>Fine Woodworking</i> magazine and an experienced custom furniture maker and restorer who's worked for the last remaining Shaker community at Sabbathday Lake, Maine, examines the Shakers' faith in relation to their furniture. Becksvoort believes that "understanding Shaker furniture requires understanding the faith of the people who created it." Their religious practices--the constant striving for spiritual perfection in everything they did, the desire to emulate Christ and to live practically, "purely, free of vanity, greed, and pride"--permeate Becksvoort's insightful discussions of the Shaker culture, their recognized inventiveness (inventions include the circular saw, apple peeler, wash mill, and chimney cap), their influence on other furniture styles, and finally the furniture itself, which is the focal point of the book. Highly perfected, free of vain ornamentation, and utterly utilitarian, the furniture is indeed the Shaker faith in physical form. In addition to covering the classics--including the ladder-back chair, trestle table, and the built-in--Becksvoort points out subtle variations in design that existed from community to community: the curved, cutout base of a case of drawers was typical for the communities in Ohio, while bevel-edged drawer lips and straight, tapered feet on a blanket box point to the Mount Lebanon community. Becksvoort's intelligent account of the Shakers and their furniture, combined with hundreds of full-color photographs, taken on location at various communities and pulled from archives, make <i>The Shaker Legacy</i> a beautiful tribute to these talented craftsmen and their enduring design. <i>--Stefanie Hargreaves</i><p>Becksvoort builds custom furniture for well-known Shaker collectors.</p></p><h2>Maestro: Homecoming, Book II</h2><p>Something terrible, unspeakable, immense, has come to Menzoberranzan and is leaving death and destruction in its wake.

To see SOS Videos and all SOS Books, click on (by Lynn Clark Author) just below the Main Title of this book. By understanding and applying insights and techniques from this book, you will learn useful self-help methods from cognitive behavior therapy. You will gain insight into changing your thoughts and feelings and for becoming more successful in attaining your goals. Knowing the five steps of Emotional Intelligence (EQ) will help you to deal with difficult people more effectively. Most people believe that bad events (such as a large credit card debt) and unpleasant people (an overly critical boss) directly cause high levels of anxiety, anger, depression and other miserable feelings. However, SOS teaches what we believe and tell ourselves about the bad events and those difficult people primarily determine our upsetness. When you believe that other people and bad events directly cause your emotions, how do you go about helping yourself to feel better? You cannot help yourself feel better. You are stuck in a rut if you believe that you must change other people or the world before you can feel better. Some people think getting very angry will cause others to change. However, others will not change as a result of your anger. Successful people find a way to change their anger into calmness and then to go about achieving their goals. SOS teaches you the steps for managing anxiety, anger, depression, and other unpleasant feelings. Our Beliefs and Self-Talk primarily cause our feelings and behavior and not bad events and difficult people. SOS teaches the reality that we are responsible for managing our feelings and behavior. SOS was updated in 2014 with the best self-help techniques from cognitive behavior therapy, the most effective form of modern therapy. Used internationally by adults, older teens, and counselors, SOS is available in 7 languages including Spanish. SOS Ayuda Con Las Emociones is also sold by Amazon.

Parker was the author of more than fifty books. He died in January 2010.Parker, author of the Spenser novels, has made this "sequel to Raymond Chandler's The Big Sleep " a stunning, drop-dead success. Private eye Philip Marlowe spins a yarn of greed, madness and death with the cool-eyed cynicism (and good-guy core) that made him the classic hardboiled dick. The era is post-WW II ("GI mortgages"), possibly early '50s ("cha cha cha"), the L.A. dream beginning to sour. Psychotic Carmen Sternwood is missing from an expensive sanatorium. After sultry Vivian has enlisted suave gangster Eddie Mars to locate her sister, the family butler, Norris, hires Marlowe for the same purpose. Sanatorium head Dr. Bonsentir stonewalls Marlowe's queries by using some heavy political clout, but further probing leads to a kinky billionaire who is practically untouchable. Marlowe is beaten up, a chopped-up body is found and an ex-inmate of the asylum dies "accidentally" before the PI uncovers a water-rights scam involving millions. Parker's effort goes beyond pastiche: he uses flashbacks from The Big Sleep daringly and seamlessly, and his terse style (a cop asks for the time of death: "Any idea when yet?") is flawlessly in Chandler's footsteps. This is dazzling. <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Norton Anthology of English Literature, Vol. 1</h2><p>The Sixth Edition of The Norton Anthology of English Literature continues to be the indispensable anthology.

Now that she&#x2019;s moved out of the world&#x2019;s most famous bachelor pad and into her own delightfully chaotic world on <i>Kendra </i>as wife to NFL star Hank Baskett and mother to their newborn son, we&#x2019;ve watched her hilarious antics as she adjusts to domestic life. But how much do we really know about the fun-loving star? In this humorous and optimistic, sometimes heartbreaking, but always unfailingly honest memoir, Kendra reveals the highs and lows of her extraordinary journey.<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>She wasn&#x2019;t always the quintessential girl next door. Before she was a reality television superstar, Hugh Hefner&#x2019;s girlfriend, or one of the most popular Playboy cover models ever, Kendra was an athletic tomboy whose father walked out on her family when she was a little girl. She grew into a rebellious teenager with a serious drug habit before she quit cold turkey and beat the odds to graduate from a high school that almost didn&#x2019;t give her a second (or third, or fourth) chance.<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>Following her rocky teenage years, an out-of-the- blue phone call from Hugh Hefner changed everything. Kendra dishes candidly about life in the Playboy Mansion: the sex, the parties, the show, and even her relationships with her <i>Girls Next Door </i>costars&#x2014;Hef, Holly, and Bridget. She tells the true story about how she and Hank met and built a relationship in secret while she was still Hef&#x2019;s girl- friend and a public face of Playboy. Finally, she reflects on the slew of unexpected changes in the short space of a year that have brought her sliding into home from Playboy party girl to wife and mother with a blooming Hollywood career. If you think you&#x2019;ve seen all of Kendra, think again. She&#x2019;s only warming up. . . . <br><br>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Kendra Wilkinson</b>&nbsp;is the star of the hit reality television show <i>Kendra</i> on E! She rose to fame in five seasons on <i>The Girls Next Door</i>, living in the Playboy Mansion as one of magazine mogul Hugh Hefner's girlfriends. Originally from San Diego, she lives in Los Angeles.<b><b>CHAPTER 1<br> </b><br><i>A Tale of Two Kendras</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;So you&#x2019;ll be naked?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, I&#x2019;ll be painted,&#x201d; I corrected Zack, my live-in boyfriend.<br><br>&#x201c;What does that mean?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know, but I&#x2019;m sure it will be fine.&#x201d;<br><br>I wasn&#x2019;t sure spending an evening as a painted girl at Hugh Hefner&#x2019;s seventy-eighth birthday party would actually be fine, but I was hoping it would turn out to be. At the very least, I would make a couple hundred dollars, meet some cool people, and get a chance to check out the Playboy Mansion. How could I turn that down?<br><br>And besides, it was Zack who had initiated the whole thing. He&#x2019;d taken me to the car show where a photographer had said he wanted to set up a photo shoot with me, and at the time Zack was all for it. So it seemed totally logical that when the photographer posted the photos on One Model Place&#x2014;a sort of MySpace for models&#x2014;if any work came from it, Zack would support me.<br><br>Well, the photographer posted the photos, and that same day a guy named Mark called from <i>Playboy</i> and asked about me.<br><br>The truth is, I wasn&#x2019;t exactly sure what the Playboy Mansion was&#x2014;or who Hugh Hefner was, for that matter. I knew about the bunny; I had an uncle who worked at the Playboy Club in Atlantic City, and he would send my brother and me T-shirts and sweatshirts with the bunny on them when we were kids. I&#x2019;d wear them to school and all the kids would tease me and say <i>Playboy</i> was gross, but I thought it was cool.<br><br>Beyond that, I didn&#x2019;t know much about <i>Playboy</i>. But I knew enough to know that getting a phone call from someone who worked there could be the beginning of something big.<br><br>Mark&#x2019;s first call wasn&#x2019;t guaranteed to lead to anything. He mentioned that he was looking for girls to work at Hef&#x2019;s upcoming birthday party. I figured <i>Playboy</i> had a lot of models to choose from for the party, and it was a long shot. But a couple of days later Mark called back.<br><br>&#x201c;Mr. Hefner saw a photo of you and wants to call you personally,&#x201d; he told me. &#x201c;I gave him your number, so expect a call.&#x201d;<br><br>I was stunned. &#x201c;What are you talking about? Expect a call? Why?&#x201d; I was weirded out by the whole thing. Why would he want to call me?<br><br>&#x201c;Listen,&#x201d; Mark said. &#x201c;He only likes girls in college, so tell him you go to college.&#x201d;<br><br>I said okay and hung up, confused.<br><br>The next day I was in the shower when the phone rang. I hopped out and saw that the call was from a 310 number. That&#x2019;s L.A. I was eighteen years old and lived in San Diego. Who did I know in L.A.?<br><br>&#x201c;Hello?&#x201d; I answered.<br><br>&#x201c;Hello, is this Kendra?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Who is this?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;This is Hugh Hefner.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah, right,&#x201d; I said, thinking it was a prank call. &#x201c;Shut the fuck up.&#x201d;<br><br>It wasn&#x2019;t a prank.<br><br>&#x201c;I look forward to seeing you at my birthday,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Also, I&#x2019;d like you to consider being my girlfriend.&#x201d;<br><br>Still dripping wet from the shower, I stood there in shock. I didn&#x2019;t know how to respond. After all, I had just told Hugh Hefner to shut the fuck up. That probably wasn&#x2019;t the reaction he&#x2019;d expected. I brushed off the girlfriend thing, since I had no idea what that even meant. When I finally collected my thoughts, I told him I would see him at his birthday party.<br><br>Just as I was wrapping up the conversation, Zack walked into the bathroom to find out who I was talking to. After I filled him in, he was as shocked as I was, and clearly a little worried.<br><br>&#x201c;I want to drive you up there,&#x201d; he said protectively.<br><br>When the big day arrived, I was kind of nervous. During the car ride Zack questioned me about how I was going to handle being invited to be Hef&#x2019;s girlfriend, but I didn&#x2019;t have an answer for him. Even though I googled Hef after we spoke on the phone, I couldn&#x2019;t really imagine what it might mean to be his girlfriend.<br><br>After a two-hour drive, Zack and I arrived at the gates of the Playboy Mansion in Bel Air. We buzzed security, who let us inside, and Zack pulled the car right up to the side entrance of the Mansion.<br><br>&#x201c;Be good,&#x201d; he said as I opened the car door.<br><br>&#x201c;Whatever,&#x201d; I mumbled back, barely even paying attention to him.<br><br>It was hard to focus once I got a good look at the Mansion. I was amazed at what I saw. Everything was so big and beautiful, and like nothing I had ever seen before. After all, I was a Hollywood virgin. Not <i>that</i> kind of virgin but, you know, still a little naive.<br><br>I got out of the car and was immediately escorted to the gym by security. I rushed by other girls and a handful of workers, and once inside the gym, Mark, who was the talent scout and body painter, told me to take off my clothes.<br><br>&#x201c;Where&#x2019;s Hugh Hefner?&#x201d; I asked as I stripped down.<br><br>&#x201c;He never comes down here,&#x201d; Mark told me.<br><br><i>That sucks!</i> I thought. I wanted to meet him and find out what he was all about.<br><br>Mark and his wife started painting me and putting rhinestones all over my body. It was all very weird. Then they moved away from my boobs and focused on my hair and makeup. I caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror. It was my first time ever having my hair and makeup done professionally, and I thought I looked like a drag queen.<br><br>Just as they were finishing making me a naked she-man, Hef&#x2014;breaking his usual rule of staying out of the painted girls&#x2019; room&#x2014;came inside. He introduced himself and gave me a hug.<br><br>My heart was racing. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve never met a celebrity before in my life,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;You are the first. This is the coolest thing.&#x201d;<br><br>It really was.<br><br>Hef laughed and we talked a little bit about the night. He told me not to be nervous and invited me to stop by his table. The conversation was short and sweet. He was very charming; he had a powerful way about him, and I liked it.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll see you upstairs,&#x201d; he said with a smile before disappearing into the night.<br><br>For those few minutes with him I forgot that I looked like a clown. A naked clown. I felt special. After all, the staff probably went through thousands of photos to find about ten painted girls, and out of those ten, Hef singled me out. The man who had created this whole world chose <i>me</i>. That felt really good.<br><br>At the party I served Jell-O shots to celebrities like Jack Nicholson, Pauly Shore, Donovan McNabb, Fred Durst, and Brooke Burke. I was starstruck, but I didn&#x2019;t act like it. I simply went up to Brooke Burke, gave her a Jell-O shot, and politely told her that I loved her. I was cool like that.<br><br>The night ended up being a lot of fun. Being practically naked was not a big deal for me, and after a while I forgot that I didn&#x2019;t like my hair and makeup.<br><br>Then Mark came up to me and told me to bring some Jell-O shots to Hef&#x2019;s table.<br><br>&#x201c;Are you sure?&#x201d; I asked nervously after glancing at Hef&#x2019;s table, which was packed with beautiful women.<br><br>As I inched my way toward the group, Hef and I locked eyes. I smiled. He was with his girlfriends, including Holly and Bridget&#x2014;who I didn&#x2019;t know at the time&#x2014;and a bunch of Barbie look-alikes, but he kept looking at me. I offered them shots and hung around the table the rest of the night. Maybe I was paranoid, but I thought the girls were giving me dirty looks the whole time, and with my eyes I tried to tell them <i>I ain&#x2019;t trying to steal your man</i>, but I wasn&#x2019;t quite sure if the message was received.<br><br>The whole evening, Hef and I kept staring at each other. It wasn&#x2019;t a physical attraction for me, but he was just so cool. The way he acted and the things he said were unlike anything I had seen or heard before.<br><br>At the end of the night Hef came up to me, gave me a key, and asked me to stay the night. I couldn&#x2019;t&#x2014;mainly because Zack was sitting outside the Mansion in his car, but beyond that, I felt that being there that night was a job, and I wanted to keep it that way. Clock in. Clock out.<br><br>I gave him the key back but told him I would see him again soon.<br><br>&#x201c;Will you be my girlfriend?&#x201d; he asked again before I left.<br><br>Staring into his eyes, I didn&#x2019;t see a man four times my age with ten times more girlfriends than most. Even though I hardly knew him yet, I saw a sweet man who made me feel really good about myself&#x2014;a true gentleman. It was weird but in my heart, I felt like he was someone I could possibly trust.<br><br>&#x201c;So, will you?&#x201d;<br><br>There was only one thing I could say: &#x201c;Um, okay.&#x201d;<br><br>That night my life changed. I had no idea what I was getting myself into, but something just felt right about it. Hef didn&#x2019;t offer me money or tell me he was going to make me a star. He didn&#x2019;t say anything, because truthfully that wasn&#x2019;t the deal. He wasn&#x2019;t trying to offer me anything other than him (and maybe a pretty cool home).<br><br>I liked what I saw at the Mansion and, more important, I liked what I saw in Hef. He was a good guy with good intentions, and in a short period of time I was able to understand that about him, so I was willing to take a risk and uproot my entire life.<br><br>I don&#x2019;t know if many girls would do that on a whim. Such an offer would scare some girls, and others might look at Hef and see dollar signs and jump at the chance to do whatever he said. I didn&#x2019;t care about that at all. Looking into Hef&#x2019;s eyes I knew there was nothing to fear, and mansion or no mansion, I was drawn to him in a way that I had never been drawn to a man before.<br><br>I couldn&#x2019;t put my finger on it, but something about that night felt so right. A new life was definitely beginning, and I was not going to stop it from happening.<br><br>As you probably know, I became Hef&#x2019;s girlfriend, moved into the Mansion full-time, and a year later began filming the hit show <i>The Girls Next Door</i>.<br><br>I was labeled the sporty party girl of the bunch, and while I didn&#x2019;t like being labeled, I certainly had a good time living up to the character the producers wanted me to play.<br><br>Life has really worked out for me. Maybe it was luck or maybe fate, but I&#x2019;m pretty blessed to be in the situation I&#x2019;m in today.<br><br>While the show may have opened the door to a charmed life and eventually helped me discover what I really wanted, the reality is, it didn&#x2019;t come easy. I wasn&#x2019;t just sitting around deciding which family business to take over when I got that call from Hef. I didn&#x2019;t just trade in one perfect life for another. It&#x2019;s been an uphill battle, and while life is great&#x2014;almost perfect, even&#x2014;right now, before I can talk about the best of times, I need to tell you about the worst . . .<br><br>� 2010 Kendra Wilkinson</p><h2>The Brothers of Gwynedd Quartet: Comprising Sunrise in the West, the Dragon at Noonday, the Hounds of Sunset, Afterglow and Nightfall</h2><p>An epic quartet of novels telling the dramatic tale of Llewelyn, the first true Prince of Wales.<br><br>Llewelyn has a burning vision: one Wales, united against the threat of the English.

She died in 1995.Those who fancy historical fiction with an emphasis on the history will savor this convincing tale of 13th-century Wales. Originally published in England as four discrete novels, the 822-page this is correct/i have finished book/pk work limns political machinations and "the cleaner business of war" in a period of Welsh national revival. Four brothers--Llewelyn, Owen Goch, Rhodri and David--vie for power among themselves and with the English king, Henry III, until Llewelyn emerges triumphant as prince of Wales. He is plagued by his favorite brother David's treacherous links to England, as well as by the reluctance of the Welsh to see themselves as a nation rather than as separate tribes. A rebellion by English barons, disrupting that country's affairs, only postpones the inevitable: the English march on Wales, Llewelyn is killed and David, who had finally sided with his brother, is executed. Without condescending to mimic medievalismsi added s/pk , the precise narrative style complements the historical authenticity of the tale.

His portraits - of people from the smallest child to the greatest hero - have garnered the respect and captured the imagination of art collectors and critics around the world.<br>The Art of James Bama is a new, comprehensive collection of his finest work, showing real people of the new West recreating their history, and descendants of the Old West paying homage to their heritage. Bama's ability to convey their emotion gives his paintings a resonance like no other.<br>The artist has long been acclaimed for his fascinating studies of the contemporary West embracing its traditional culture - portraits that seem to go beyond the surface of the model to the essence of the inner person. In these pages you will meet the oldest living Crow Indian, a man who would be Buffalo Bill, and even Doc Savage, as well as men and women of the new West keeping the traditions of the Old West alive.<br>James Bama's art has been collected and exhibited in major museum shows, in many prestigious collections, and now in this beautiful book, which presents works from throughout his fine art career, many seen for the first time here. All are splendidly reproduced in full color under the auspices of The Greenwich Workshop, Bama's exclusive limited edition print publisher and the largest fine art print publisher in North America.<br>"The way people feel inside is not always the way they appear outwardly," says the artist. "In my paintings, I try to capture their innermost feelings. I would like to think that the body of work I produce makes a valid statement about life and is unique in that it is not something that has been done before."</p><p></p><h2>The Lusitania: Finally the Startling Truth about One of the Most Fateful of All Disasters of the Sea</h2><p>A correspondent for the London Sunday Times unfolds the events surrounding the sinking of the Lusitania, presenting startling evidence about the role of British and American officials in this disaster</p><p></p><h2>Loves Music, Loves To Dance</h2><p>When Robin probes the disappearance of her close friend, Marcy, a young woman who answers an ad in a magazine &#34;personals&#34; section, she finds herself the prey of a serial killer with a special fetish</p><p>A Dance of Death...

Baring, a London-based Jungian analyst, and Cashford, who writes on mythology, regard the formal disappearance of goddess myths as a pivotal event signaling the devaluation of the feminine and the opposition of feeling to thinking. They interpret the Virgin Mary as the unrecognized mother goddess of Christianity, identify hidden images of the goddess in the Old Testament and demonstrate that a Hebrew goddess existed in various forms such as the Shekhinah, founder of the world in Kabbalism. A wonderfully readable synthesis, this monumental study is packed wth scores of riveting illustrations. It will serve as a sourcebook for students of myth, feminists and those seeking to balance and integrate masculine and feminine components of their psyche. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Doctrine of Prayer</h2><p>Examines biblical teachings on the vital subject of prayer</p><p></p><h2>Intermediate Microeconomics: A Modern Approach</h2><p>Intermediate Microeconomics, 9/E<br>Rigorous and modern--the #1 text for Intermediate Microeconomics from the chief economist at Google.This best-selling text is still the most modern presentation of the subject.

Now retired from tending his flock in the village of Mitford, he is making good on a promise to show his wife, Cynthia, the charming land of his Irish ancestors. But after arriving at a Lough Arrow fishing lodge in the midst of a torrential downpour, the charm disappears.<br><br>They find their holiday upended by an intruder, a treasured painting is stolen from the lodge, and a family conflict dating back nearly a century turns even more bitter. As three generations struggle to find deliverance from the crucifying power of secrets, Tim and Cynthia stumble upon a faded journal that might just explain the crime&#x2014;and offer a chance at redemption.</p><p><b>Jan Karon</b>, born Janice Meredith Wilson in the foothills of North Carolina, was named after the title of a popular novel, Janice Meredith.<p>Jan wrote her first novel at the age of ten. "The manuscript was written on Blue Horse notebook paper, and was, for good reason, kept hidden from my sister. When she found it, she discovered the one curse word I had, with pounding heart, included in someone's speech. For Pete's sake, hadn't Rhett Butler used that very same word and gotten away with it? After my grandmother's exceedingly focused reproof, I've written books without cussin' ever since."</p><p>Several years ago, Karon left a successful career in advertising to move to the mountain village of Blowing Rock, North Carolina, and write books. "I stepped out on faith to follow my lifelong dream of being an author," she says. "I made real sacrifices and took big risks. But living, it seems to me, is largely about risk."</p><p>Enthusiastic booksellers across the country have introduced readers of all ages to Karon's heartwarming books. <i>At Home in Mitford</i>, Karon's first book in the Mitford series, was nominated for an ABBY by the American Booksellers Association in 1996 and again in 1997. Bookstore owner, Shirley Sprinkle, says, "The Mitford Books have been our all-time fiction bestsellers since we went in business twenty-five years ago. We've sold 10,000 of Jan's books and don't see any end to the Mitford phenomenon."</p><b>ONE</b><p>The beams of their hired car scarcely penetrated a summer twilight grown dark as pitch in the downpour.</p><p>His wife's fear of being hemmed in was only slightly greater than his own. As the road narrowed to a lane the width of a sheep track, he took Cynthia's hand and peered out to sullen hedges pressing on either side. He was peevish at being crammed into a rain-hammered Volvo with a testy driver and a box of books which for some bizarre reason they had thought they couldn't live without.</p><p>He closed his eyes, then thought it best to keep them open. He was a lousy traveler. Indeed, the aggravation of getting from Atlanta to Dublin had exceeded his worst expectations.</p><p>Following a delay of seven hours due to storms in the Atlanta area, the trip across the Pond had been an unnerving piece of business which shortened his temper and swelled his feet to ridiculous proportions. Then, onto a commuter flight to Sligo Airport at Strandhill, where&#x2014;and this was the final straw, or so he hoped&#x2014;they met the antiquated vehicle that would take them to the lodge on Lough Arrow. When he located an online Sligo car service a month back and figured how to dial the country code, hadn't he plainly said this trip would celebrate his wife's birthday as well as her first time in Ireland? Hadn't he specified a <i>nice</i> car?</p><p>In any case, they'd be getting no consolation from the driver, a small, wiry fellow so hunkered over the wheel that little more was visible than his headgear&#x2014;a mashed and hapless affair of uncertain purpose, possibly a hat.</p><p>He had visited County Sligo as a bachelor ten years ago, with his attorney cousin, Walter, and Walter's wife, Katherine; they had driven to and from the fishing lodge on this same road. In any weather, it was no place to meet oncoming vehicles.</p><p>He unbuckled the seat belt and leaned forward.</p><p>'Aengus, I think we should pull off.'</p><p>'What's that?'</p><p>'I think we should pull off,' he shouted above the din of rain and wipers.</p><p>'No place to pull off.'</p><p>'Ask him how he can possibly see anything,' said Cynthia.</p><p>'How can you possibly...?'</p><p>'I see th' wall on m' left an' keep to it.'</p><p>'Doesn't appear to be any cars coming, why don't we stop and wait it out?' Torrential. Second only to the hurricane he'd driven through in Whitecap.</p><p>'I'll get round th' bend there an' see what's ahead.' Aengus muttered, shook his head. 'Bleedin' rain, an' fog t' bleedin' boot.'</p><p>'It's what keeps you green,' shouted his wife, opting for the upbeat.</p><p>'That's what they all say. M'self, I'm after goin' on holiday to Ibiza.'</p><p>He sat back and tried to stuff his right foot into the shoe he'd removed on entering the car.</p><p>'Timothy,' said his wife, 'if there's no place to pull off, what happens when people meet another vehicle?'</p><p>'Someone has to back up. I never quite understood how that gets decided. Anyway, there'll be a pull-off along here somewhere; they seem to appear at very providential places.'</p><p>'When he said he keeps to the wall, I realized those aren't hedges. There's stone under all those vines.'</p><p>He thought she looked mildly accusing, as if he'd neglected to pass along this wisdom.</p><p>'Walls!' reiterated Aengus. 'Landlord walls.'</p><p>He had promised her this trip for years, and for one reason or another, it had been often deferred, twice rescheduled, and even now there was a glitch. Last week, Walter and Katherine had been forced to postpone tomorrow's planned arrival in Sligo until four days hence. Walter's apologies were profuse; after months of red tape and head scratching, he said, the date for meeting with a big client had come out of the blue. His cousin hated the inconvenience it would cause; after all, Katherine was the only one among them with guts to drive the Irish roadways. She was a regular Stirling Moss&#x2014;fearless, focused, fast. Too fast, the cousins had long agreed, but what could they do? They were both cowards, unfit for the job.</p><p>Until Walter and Katherine arrived at the lodge with wheels, he and Cynthia would be stuck like moss on a log. 'How will you manage?' Walter had asked.</p><p>'Very well, indeed,' he said. In truth, Walter and Katherine's delay was the best of news. He and Cynthia were badly in need of four uneventful days, having been thrashed by the affairs of recent months.</p><p>Soon after she fractured her ankle and lapsed, unwilling, into what she called her Long and Unlovely Confinement, he learned he had a half-brother in Mississippi. There had been a few shocks in his seventy years, most of them occurring during forty-plus years as a priest, but never anything like this.</p><p>As a kid, he'd once pulled that nearly impossible stunt of St. Paul's and prayed without ceasing&#x2014;for a brother. It didn't work. Then, sixty years later, there was Henry Winchester. Henry, with acute myelogenous leukemia, needing stem cells from a close relative.</p><p>He had quartered in Memphis with Cynthia for weeks, giving over his stem cells through apheresis, standing watch at Henry's bedside and feeling in an odd and confusing way that he was fighting for his own life. His long road trip in a vintage Mustang hadn't helped, of course. Then, playing out the proverb of 'when it rains it pours,' came the sudden flare-up of his diabetes only days ago.</p><p>'There's no way we're not going,' he told his wife, whose recent sixty-fourth birthday had gone largely uncelebrated.</p><p>'There's no way we're not going,' he told his doctor, who had seen him through two diabetic comas and was as hidebound as they come. Hoppy Harper had preached him the lipids sermon followed by the exercise sermon, pulled a stern face to ram the points home, then caved. 'So, go,' he said, popping a jelly bean.</p><p>Four days. To walk the shores of Lough Arrow. To row to an island in the middle of the lake and picnic with Cynthia. To sit and stare&#x2014;gaping, if need be&#x2014;at nothing or everything.</p><p>It would be roughly in the spirit of their honeymoon by the lake in Maine, where their grandest amenity was a kerosene lamp. It had rained then, too. He remembered the sound of it on the tin roof of the camp, and the first sight of her in the white nightgown, her hair damp from the shower, and her eyes lit by an inner fire that was at once deeply familiar and strangely new. He hadn't really known until then why he'd never before loved profoundly.</p><p>Cynthia nudged him with her elbow. 'We're around the bend.'</p><p>He leaned forward and shouted, 'We're around the bend. You were going to stop.'</p><p>'There's nothin' so bad it couldn't be worse&#x2014;another bend comin' up.'</p><p>He sank back in the seat. 'That's the way of bends. They keep coming up.'</p><p>'What am I t' call you?' shouted Aengus. 'Are ye th' father or th' rev'rend?'</p><p>'Reverend,' he said. 'I'm the Father back home, but in your country only Catholic priests are addressed as Father.'</p><p>'Here for th' fishin', you an' th' missus?'</p><p>'No fishing.'</p><p>' 't is th' fishin' capital of th' west, you should have a go at it.'</p><p>'We could reach out and touch those walls,' she said. 'It looks like we're going to rip the side mirrors off their hinges.'</p><p>He made another feckless go at shoeing his right foot. 'Always looks that way.' His earlier foray here had earned him rights to play the old head. 'Never happens.'</p><p>Aengus gave him a shout. 'I've been thinkin', Rev'rend.'</p><p>'What's that?'</p><p>'There's seven or eight them Kav'na families in Easkey.'</p><p>'Good. Wonderful.'</p><p>She foraged in her handbag, which did double duty as mobile library and snack hamper. 'Here,' she said. 'Eat this. It's been four hours.'</p><p>Raisins. He ate a handful with a kind of simple shame, recalling chocolate with macadamias.</p><p>She leaned close, her breath warm in his ear. 'Do you think he does this for a living? He isn't wearing a uniform or anything.'</p><p>'Ask him,' he said. He was sick of yelling.</p><p>She unbuckled her seat belt and leaned forward to the hat. 'Mr. Malone, do you do this for a living?'</p><p>'What's that?'</p><p>'Drive tourists. Is it what you do... all the time?'</p><p>' 't is the only time. 't is m' brother's oul' clunker. I mow verges for th' Council at Sligo.'</p><p>She sat back and rebuckled. 'He mows verges,' she said, looking straight ahead. 'It's the only time he's done this.'</p><p>There was no point in pursuing that line of thought. 'The sides of the road where weeds grow,' he said, in case she didn't know from verges.</p><p>Rain drummed the roof. The fan in the dash spewed air smelling of aftershave. They moved at a crawl.</p><p>'Mother of God!' shouted Aengus.</p><p>The sudden slam of brakes jolted them forward. A blinding light... on top of them. His heart pounded into his throat.</p><p>Aengus flashed the Volvo's high beams, scraped the gears in reverse, and squinted into the rearview mirror.</p><p>'Bloody lorry,' he snapped. 'We'll be backin' up.'</p><br><p><b>TWO</b></p><p>The walls ended; the rain slackened; parting clouds liberated scraps of pale light. The hedges now were merely tumbled stones and August bloom twined with ivy, foxglove, scarlet creeper.</p><p>Aengus Malone had learned a certain dexterity on his mower; his skill at locating and backing into the previously overlooked pull-off had been brilliant. The lorry driver had given three blasts of his horn as a thumbs-up.</p><p>'That was some scrape you bailed us out of,' he said to Aengus. 'Well done.'</p><p>'It's m' lucky hat that done it.' Aengus reached up and patted the thing. 'Me oul' mum give it to me.'</p><p>'If it weren't so dark,' said Cynthia, 'we might see a rainbow.'</p><p>'There's some as see rainbows at night, but those would be fairies.'</p><p>'You believe in fairies?'</p><p>'Ah, no, not a bit. But they're there noneth'less.'</p><p>'You've never seen one, then?'</p><p>'If it's fairies ye're after, they're said to be very numerous in Mayo.'</p><p>On a slope in a grove of ancient beeches, the dusky, formless shape of the lodge appeared, its windows luminous against a starless night.</p><p>His wife drew in her breath.</p><p>Broughadoon.</p><p>'That would be candles burnin',' said Aengus. The Volvo rattled over a cattle grate. 'Looks like th' rain's shut down your power.'</p><p>'Stop,' said Cynthia. 'Please.'</p><p>Aengus braked; the motor idled.</p><p>'It's the most beautiful sight I've ever seen.'</p><p>She sat for a moment, bound in one of her spells, then opened the door. A pure and solemn air spilled in; his right foot slipped into his loafer.</p><p>She got out of the car and stood looking along the slope to the fishing lodge, at fog drifting among the cloistered beeches. 'Listen,' she said.</p><p>They listened.</p><p>'Nothin' much t' hear,' said Aengus.</p><p>Rain dripped from the shadowed trees, pattered on the roof of the car; a breeze stirred.</p><p>He watched as she got back in the car and closed the door and looked at him and smiled. Then she leaned to him and kissed him. Her faint scent of wisteria mingled with the Sligo air. He had never been so happy in his life.</p><p>As they drew up to the lodge, figures appeared on the stoop, silhouetted against the light from the open front door. Three barking dogs bounded onto the gravel and squared off with the Volvo.</p><p>There was a considerable shaking of hands with innkeepers Liam and Anna Conor, as the dogs ganged a-glee about their feet&#x2014;two Labradors, and a Jack Russell dancing on its hind legs.</p><p>Anna, the striking-looking woman he'd known a decade earlier, gave him a hand-wringing that jimmied his teeth. He admired all over again her tousle of copper-colored hair and, without meaning to, blurted the sentiment aloud.</p><p>They were joined by a white-haired old man wearing a tie and cardigan and brandishing a walking stick. In the gabble of greetings, he decried their weather as 'foul and infernal.'</p><p>Somewhere, thanks be to God, something was cooking. 'Lamb,' he said to his wife. He could devour a table leg.</p><p>He recognized the feeling he experienced on his wedding day nearly eight years ago&#x2014;as if he'd lost the proper sense of things and stepped outside his body. He was a cannonball fired directly from the quiet desperation of a hired car into a domestic muddle of energy and good cheer.</p><p>They were herded through an entrance hall, its walls fairly crammed with fish mounted in glass cases, and into a sitting room lit by candles and an open fire. A half-finished jigsaw puzzle was spread on a table among a loose aggregation of sofas and wing chairs.</p><p>He felt at once the keen pleasure of the room: its book-lined walls and good pictures, the impression of ease.</p><p>In a corner, three men murmured over a card game by the light of a candle. A distinguished-looking fellow sat reading a newspaper by the firelight and stroking his white mustache; upon seeing them, he stood at once and buttoned his jacket.</p><p>'Heads up, gentlemen...' Anna lifted a small bell from the sofa table and pealed it. 'Reverend Timothy Kav'na and Mrs. Kav'na of North Carolina, meet our anglers&#x2014;Tom Snyder of Toronto, Hugh Finnegan of Maryland, and there's Pete O'Malley. Pete's a Dub who lived many years in Texas.'</p><p>'O'Malley here.' O'Malley stood, saluted. 'Welcome.' The other two pushed back their chairs, stood, raised a hand.</p><p>'They're with us every August since 1997,' said Anna. 'They're after catching our dinner tomorrow.'</p><p>He gave the trio a thumbs-up. 'Go, Terps,' he said to Hugh Finnegan.</p><p>'And there's Seamus Doyle from up the hill at Catharmore, who visits most evenings with the Labs. Seamus is our master of assorted entertainments, chiefly checkers and jigsaw puzzles.'</p><p>Seamus of the white mustache crossed to them for another round of hand-shaking. 'How long will you be in Ireland, Reverend?'</p><p>'A couple of weeks.'</p><p>'They say a couple of weeks makes a habit.'</p><p>'We wouldn't be against it. Not a bit.'</p><p>'I spent a lot of years in the States. Always good to see someone from the oul' country, as I call it.'</p><p>He surveyed the room and those in it&#x2014;a whole universe of life and pluck at the end of a narrow road in the middle of nowhere.</p><p>Somehow, the two three-suiters, the umbrella, and the glasses case he'd left on the backseat got toted in by Liam. Then came Aengus, tailed by the two Labs, schlepping the carton of books, their carry-ons, a flashlight, and the box of raisins. Off they went across a sitting room carpet worn to the lining, and along a hall, where the lot of them vanished into the gloom. A young woman with a nose ring and cheek tattoo offered hot towels; the Jack Russell sat at his feet, looking up, a chewed shoe clenched in its jaws.</p><p>It was all a dazzle. After years of talking, planning, and idle speculation, they were here. He wanted to sprawl before the open fire like a lizard and lose consciousness.</p><p>Cynthia had stepped away to look at a painting he remembered&#x2014;of men in curraghs spearing basking whales in the treacherous seas off Arranmore.</p><p>'It's good to have you back,' said Anna. There was an honest country style about her garb of shirt, skirt, apron, and clogs.</p><p>'It's great to be back. The trip is my wife's birthday present.'</p><p>' 't is no surprise your wife is beautiful.'</p><p>'Yes,' he said. 'Inside and out.' He wasn't likely to get over his pride in showing her off.

She lives in Wales.This collection of essays and excerpts from the globe-spanning career of Morris, one of the most admired and imitated travel writers alive, is fantastic in its depth and breadth. But whether it also succeeds as a portrait of the world in the years 1950-2000 depends on readers' response to Morris's impressionistic style. Morris had the good fortune of beginning her career (when she was still James Morris) writing for two great British newspapers, the Times and the Guardian, when the British Empire still spanned the world, and she's spent much of her career writing about former colonies. But she is much more than a chronicler of empire. This work finds Morris in Atlanta, Jerusalem, Baghdad, Capetown, Kyoto, Odessa, La Paz, Sydney and Addis Ababa, to name just a few cities from which she files reports in the first two decades of the period alone. Her style of reporting, increasingly abstract as time passes (and increasingly joyous following her sex-change operation in Morocco, a story she tells from a touchingly wry distance), finds her ignoring politicians and celebrities in favor of the wisdom of cab drivers and the tone of street signs. Her job, as she writes, is "simply to grin like a dog and run about the city." A brief, pessimistic epilogue aside, Morris likes what she has seen in the world. Inevitably, her many devoted readers will be disappointed by the necessary brevity of most of the excerpts here (she has written more than 30 books), but as an introduction to the writer's luminous prose, there is no better place to start. 6 illus. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Christian Reflections</h2><p>C.S.

This intriguing and biblically sound book clearly shows the significance of each Feast of the Lord&#x2014;and how they all point to Jesus. Dr. Richard Booker depicts the unity found in God&#x2019;s unfolding purposes for His people, be they Jew or Gentile, from the new birth found in Passover and the Crucifixion, all the way to entering God&#x2019;s rest found in the Feast of Tabernacles and the Second Coming. The Always-Present One said to Moses, &#x201c;Tell the people of Israel: &#x2018;You will announce the Always-Present One&#x2019;s appointed feasts (festivals) as holy gatherings. These {are} My special feasts (Leviticus 23:1-2 PEB). The Feasts of the Lord given originally to Israel are pictures of the Messiah, and represent seven phases of spiritual growth in the life of believers: � Passover. � Unleavened Bread. � First Fruits. � Pentecost. � Trumpets. � Atonement. � Tabernacles. Welcome the relevance and richness of celebrating the feasts today!</p><p>Dr. Richard Booker has written 30 books and is considered a pioneer and spiritual father in teaching on Israel, Jewish-Christian relations, and the biblical Hebraic roots of Christianity. For 20 years he and his wife, Peggy, have led tour groups to Israel where Dr. Booker has been a featured speaker at the Christian celebration of the Feast of Tabernacles in Jerusalem.</p><h2>Church Fathers: From Clement of Rome to Augustine</h2><p>Following his best selling book, <i>Jesus of Nazareth</i>, and his talks published in <i>Jesus, the Apostles, and the Early Church</i>, Pope Benedict's <i>Church Fathers</i>presents these important figures of early Christianity in all their evangelical vitality, spiritual profundity, and uncompromising love of God. Benedict tells the true story of Christianity's against-all-odds triumph in the face of fierce pagan Roman hostility and persecution. He does this by exploring the lives and the ideas of the early Christian writers, pastors, and martyrs, the men so important to the spread of Christianity that history knows them as "the Fathers of the Church". <p> This rich and engrossing survey of the early Church includes those churchmen who immediately succeeded the Apostles, the "Apostolic Fathers": Clement of Rome, Ignatius of Antioch, Justin Martyr, and Irenaeus of Lyon. Benedict also discusses such great Christian figures as Tertullian, Origen, and Cyprian of Carthage, the Cappadocian Fathers, as well as the giants John Chrysostom, Jerome, Augustine, Leo the Great, and Benedict of Nursia, the Pope's namesake. This book is a wonderful way to get to know the Church Fathers and the tremendous spiritually rich patrimony they have bequeathed to us.</p></p><p><p><strong>Pope Benedict XVI (Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger)</strong> is widely recognized as one of the most brilliant theologians and spiritual leaders of our age. As Pope he authored the best-selling <em>Jesus of Nazareth</em>; and prior to his pontificate, he wrote many influential books that continue to remain important for the contemporary Church, such as <em>Introduction to Christianity</em> and <em>The Spirit of the Liturgy</em>.</p></p><h2>The Target (FBI Thriller)</h2><p>Catherine Coulter's sensational contemporary suspense novels <i>The Cove</i> and <i>The Maze</i> were gripping enough to establish Coulter firmly in the genre, hailed <i>Publishers Weekly</i>. Now, with <i>The Target</i>, Coulter again lays claim to the territory where romance and terror intersect. Hoping to escape unwanted celebrity in the aftermath of a notorious incident, Ramsey Hunt settles in the Rockies, determined to bury himself in the safety of a solitary existence. But his isolation is shattered when he stumbles upon a small girl unconscious in the high-altitude forest. When strangers pursue Ramsey to his private meadow in an attempt to kill him and the girl, he's mystified that anyone would wish her harm. And the child can't shed any light on the subject: she's mute. Molly Santana, the girl's mother, catches up with Ramsey and her daughter, mistaking her daughter's savior for a kidnapper. But soon Ramsey's real role becomes clear. With the strangers in pursuit, the trio flee to Chicago for sanctuary. Even there, however, the child's enemies prove as relentless as their motives are baffling. With an unexpected assist from FBI agents Dillon Savich and Lacey Sherlock (last seen in <i>The Maze</i>), Molly and Ramsey begin to unravel the clues, and in the process they make an astonishing discovery as to the true nature of the target.</p><p>The Bookcassette� format is a special recording technique developed as a means of condensing the full, unabridged audio text of a book to record it on fewer tapes.

Published by Broadway,2001, Binding: Paperback</p><p>Bill Bryson follows his Appalachian amble, <i>A Walk in the Woods</i>, with the story of his exploits in Australia, where A-bombs go off unnoticed, prime ministers disappear into the surf, and cheery citizens coexist with the world's deadliest creatures: toxic caterpillars, aggressive seashells, crocodiles, sharks, snakes, and the deadliest of them all, the dreaded box jellyfish. And that's just the beginning, as Bryson treks through sunbaked deserts and up endless coastlines, crisscrossing the "under-discovered" Down Under in search of all things interesting.<p> Bryson, who could make a pile of dirt compelling--and yes, Australia <i>is</i> mostly dirt--finds no shortage of curiosities. When he isn't dodging Portuguese man-of-wars or considering the virtues of the remarkable platypus, he visits southwest Gippsland, home of the world's largest earthworms (up to 12 feet in length). He discovers that Australia, which began nationhood as a prison, contains the longest straight stretch of railroad track in the world (297 miles), as well as the world's largest monolith (the majestic Uluru) and largest living thing (the Great Barrier Reef). He finds ridiculous place names: "Mullumbimby Ewylamartup, Jiggalong, and the supremely satisfying Tittybong," and manages to catch a cricket game on the radio, which is like </p><blockquote>listening to two men sitting in a rowboat on a large, placid lake on a day when the fish aren't biting; it's like having a nap without losing consciousness. It actually helps not to know quite what's going on. In such a rarefied world of contentment and inactivity, comprehension would become a distraction.</blockquote><p> "You see," Bryson observes, "Australia is an interesting place. It truly is. And that really is all I'm saying." Of course, Bryson--who is as much a travel writer here as a humorist, naturalist, and historian--says much more, and does so with generous amounts of wit and hilarity. Australia may be "mostly empty and a long way away," but it's a little closer now. <i>--Rob McDonald</i></p>Every time Bill Bryson walks out the door, memorable travel literature threatens to break out. His previous excursion along the Appalachian Trail resulted in the sublime national bestseller "A Walk in the Woods. "In A Sunburned Country is his report on what he found in an entirely different place: Australia, the country that doubles as a continent, and a place with the friendliest inhabitants, the hottest, driest weather, and the most peculiar and lethal wildlife to be found on the planet. The result is a deliciously funny, fact-filled, and adventurous performance by a writer who combines humor, wonder, and unflagging curiousity. <br>Despite the fact that Australia harbors more things that can kill you in extremely nasty ways than anywhere else, including sharks, crocodiles, snakes, even riptides and deserts, Bill Bryson adores the place, and he takes his readers on a rollicking ride far beyond that beaten tourist path. Wherever he goes he finds Australians who are cheerful, extroverted, and unfailingly obliging, and these beaming products of land with clean, safe cities, cold beer, and constant sunshine fill the pages of this wonderful book. Australia is an immense and fortunate land, and it has found in Bill Bryson its perfect guide.</p><h2>The Season of Passage</h2><p>Dr. Lauren Wagner was a celebrity. She was involved with the most exciting adventure mankind had ever undertaken.

Lauren Wagner screamed. Still caught in the web of her nightmare, she shoved at the small hand that held her arm. Jennifer, her younger sister, fell to the ground atop a scattering of pine needles. But Jennifer quickly sprang to her feet and reached out once more.<br>"Jenny," Lauren said, disgusted when she saw what she had done. Her T-shirt was drenched with sweat and her heart was pounding. She gave Jennifer a quick hug. "Are you OK? I didn't mean to push you. I was having a nightmare."<br>"I'm fine," Jennifer said, more serious than startled.<br>"I'm sorry." Lauren busied her hands over her sister's clothes. She realized she was trembling, and had to make a conscious effort to stop. Jennifer watched her closely, her clear blue eyes alert.<br>"You called someone, Lauren," she said. "Whose name did you call?"<br>Lauren hugged her thirteen-year-old sister again, tighter this time, and buried her face in Jennifer's brilliant hair. The chair she had dozed off in rocked forward on the forest floor. "Was I talking in my sleep?" she asked. "I had the strangest dream."<br>Jennifer undid Lauren's hands and took a step back. Behind her, the orange light of the evening sun shone on the tops of the surrounding pine trees. Wash Lake, a hundred yards off to their left, was a deep blue, calm and clear in the quiet of the forest. The fragrance of wild dandelions and blooming sunflowers was in the air. Yet in that moment it seemed to Lauren that Jennifer was not standing in the beautiful mountains of Wyoming, but in another place, a place where there was little beauty, and no sweet smells. Jennifer's gaze was far away and troubled.<br>"Whose name did you call?" Jennifer repeated.<br>Lauren forced a laugh and squeezed Jennifer's shoulders. "You just startled me, is all. That's why I jumped. My dream--why, I can't even remember it. It was nothing. It was only a nightmare."<br>Jennifer looked doubtful. She gestured to stump near Terry's cabin. "I was reading a book. Then you called me."<br>Lauren wanted to change the subject. "What book are you reading?" She started to run her fingers through Jennifer's long blond hair, but Jennifer shook her head and stepped away.<br>"Just a story," she said. "It's nothing." Turning, she walked over to the stump and picked up her book. She sat down and began to read, without looking back up.<br>Lauren frowned. Jennifer was a paradox, she thought, full of joy one moment, troubled and serious the next. Sometimes she wondered if Jennifer spent too much time with her nose in books. It was not unusual for Jennifer to go through five novels a week, all kinds of novels: science fiction, fantasy, adventure books, and westerns. Lauren never censored them. She didn't understand why Jennifer hadn't answered her question.<br>But that reminded Lauren. She still had to read Terry's article. Terry Hayes was her fianc�, a newspaper reporter for the <i>Houston Herald</i>. Lauren picked up the paper from where it had fallen when she jumped up out of her nightmare. The front page was dominated by a color picture that Terry had taken of the crew members of America's first expedition to Mars. Lauren was in the middle, down in front.<br>It was odd--she had been looking at the picture when she had fallen asleep. She knew her nightmare had had something to do with Mars. She called over to Jennifer. "Terry wanted me to critique the second part of his article, but I've only got the first part. Didn't you tell me that boyfriend of yours could get me a copy of the <i>Herald</i>?"<br>Jennifer glanced up and blushed. "He's not my boyfriend."<br>"Then why were you holding his hand?"<br>"I didn't hold his hand. I didn't."<br>"I understand. He was holding your hand."<br>Jennifer had forgotten her book. "Were you spying on us?"<br>"I wouldn't dream of it."<br>"Right," Jennifer said sarcastically.<br>Lauren was thoughtful. "But I do seem to remember seeing him kiss you. Accidentally seeing you, that is. It was on the cheek."<br>"He never!" Jennifer said indignantly.<br>"On the cheek but not far from your lips. A very long kiss, if my memory serves me correctly."<br>Jennifer seemed about to make another sharp retort when she burst out laughing. "You're just jealous because he thinks I'm prettier than you."<br>Lauren blinked, surprised. "He said that?"<br>Jennifer nodded, smug. Of course, Lauren had to agree with the young man. Jennifer was an exceptional beauty, one of those children who could turn a dozen heads in a crowded mall. Her features showed an interesting play of contradictory genes. They were clearly defined, yet also delicate, waiflike. She spent many hours outdoors, and as a result always had a decent tan, which went well with her blue eyes. The latter possessed a cerulean clarity that was seldom found except in newborn babies. But it was her hair that was her crowning glory: long and curly, naturally blond to the point of looking bleached. On sunny days it swirled around her sleek shoulders like a protective aura. To look at Jennifer was to see something beautiful; it was as simple as that.<br>"You told me his name," Lauren said. "What is it? Dave?"<br>"Daniel."<br>"I see, Daniel. Not Dan or Danny, but Daniel."<br>"I thought calling him by his proper name would make him feel more important." Jennifer explained.<br>"Did you read that in a book?"<br>Jennifer shook her head.<br>"Are you sure?" Lauren asked.<br>"No.Yes! I like that name, Daniel."<br>Lauren eyed her sister's discarded book. "What are you reading anyway?"<br>Jennifer bowed her head and touched the book's dull red cover. "Just something I found at the library."<br>"And it's a secret?"<br>Jennifer hesitated. "It's a love story."<br>Lauren laughed. "I bet Danny--Daniel told you to read it. I'm going to make sure Terry watches you closely the next two years." Instantly, Lauren regretted mentioning her leaving, although it was something they had talked about enough. She knew Jennifer preferred not to discuss the expedition to Mars while they were in Wyoming. It was strange--her sister had no trouble with the subject when they were in Houston. Lauren added. "Will Daniel be here soon?"<br>Jennifer brightened. "He said yesterday that he'd be here at six. He's going to show me one of his weapons."<br>"Sounds like a date to me." Lauren checked the position of the sun. "He should be here any minute. Do you want me to take a walk?"<br>"You don't have to," Jennifer said, although she quickly stood, like maybe it wouldn't be a bad idea. Lauren took the hint and got up, tucking Terry's newspaper in her white shorts. The air was warm and dry, and the feel of the sun on her bare legs was delicious.<br>"I need the exercise," Lauren said. "What did you mean, he's going to show you one of his weapons? Is he in the service?"<br>Jennifer giggled. "No. He's only fourteen. He collects weapons. He's part Indian."<br>Lauren nodded. "That explains it. Is he going to show you how to shoot a bow and arrow?"<br>"No. He's bringing an elephant rifle."<br>"Great. My little sister's chasing an Indian who hunts elephants in a pine forest." Jennifer thought that was funny. Lauren continued, "I bought some Cokes in town yesterday, if you want to give your friend a drink. And Jenny, if Terry comes, have Daniel give a blast on his gun."<br>"What if he doesn't bring any bullets?"<br>Lauren was already among the trees, the pine needles crackling under her bare feet. "Then have him send up smoke signals," she called.<br>Soon Lauren reached the shore of the lake, where she turned west, heading in the direction of the sun. It was not long before she entered the shallows and broke into a jog, and then began to run. She loved to race along the shore and feel the sand between her toes and the water splashing up her back. She ran for five hard minutes, and covered at least a mile--for she was in excellent shape, and had always been fast on her feet. She only stopped when she came to wide stream, which from experience she knew to have the slipperiest rocks in all of Wyoming. She had a tiny dent on the back of her skull courtesy of the stream.<br>She was hot, and the lake was tempting. Unfortunately, she didn't have her suit, and her shorts and T-shirt felt like lead weights when they were wet. Plus she was something of a celebrity these days, what with the launch date only a couple of weeks away. It wouldn't do to have one of NASA's leading public relations specimens to be photographed nude.<br><i>Then again, it might do wonders for their budget</i>.<br>Lauren listened closely for a minute, scanning the beach in both directions and finding no one. What decided her in the end was the thought of not seeing any green or open water for two whole years. She had to embrace nature while she could, and if someone did snap her picture, at least she would look like she was having fun. She had her shorts and shirt off in five seconds, and was in water over her head in another ten. It was not merely cold, it was liquid ice, and she loved it. Wash Lake was a half mile across, and she swam strongly toward the center. Had it not been for her bare bottom, she would have tried to swim to the far shore.<br>But her run must have taken more out of her than she realized. Close to the middle of the lake, she found herself working hard, and decided to roll over on her back and take it easy. She drifted along for some time, paddling just enough to stay afloat. Out of the corners of her eyes, the trees looked ten times more distant than they really were, as they always did from surface level. The sky began to darken as the sun slipped behind a forested ridge, and the water temperature finally made itself felt on her muscles. After all the money NASA had invested in her training, it would be a bummer is she drowned. Yet it was with regret that she rolled onto her belly and began to swim toward the shore. She knew even then that she would remember this swim while she was walking across the sands of Mars.<br>Out of the water, Lauren plopped down on a boulder beside the stream and slipped back into her clothes. The evening air held the day's warmth--she didn't mind the damp material clinging to her skin. She had left the paper in the sand. She picked it up and flipped to Terry's article.<br>&nbsp;<br>WAR OF THE WORLDS<br>By Terry Hayes, Reporter<br>&nbsp;<br>Houston. On October 28, 2002, almost two years ago, two Russian spacecraft touched down on Mars, in the mountainous region known as Tharsis. The expedition was headed by Dmitri Maximov. For ten days his men explored the area, beaming to Earth incredible footage of the alien landscape. But then, on November 6, all contact with them was lost. Two days later, communication was also lost with Carl Bensk, the sole cosmonaut aboard the mother ship, in orbit around Mars. Since that time, neither the men on the planet, nor Carl Bensk, have been heard from. They are presumed dead.<br>What happened to them? Five major theories have been put forth to explain their disappearance: 1) mechanical failure; 2) natural calamity; 3) alien infection; 4) alien monsters; and 5) insanity.<br>Of these five theories, the first is thought most likely, but only in the improbable context of the others. The chance of both communication systems on board the landers failing simultaneously is astronomically small. Furthermore, the two craft landed almost a mile apart. If one had exploded during takeoff, the other would have been spared. For the mechanical theory to hold water, the mother ship would also have had to suffer a major system failure. The theory breaks down under even the most casual scrutiny.<br>A natural calamity? Mars is now known to have sandstorms, and earthquakes are much more common there than on Earth. It snowed often while the Russians were in communication. The Tharsis region is also volcanic, or at least it has been in the past. However, satellites circling Mars reported no unusual weather during the period in question, and no obvious eruptions. In either case, the orbiting ship should have been unaffected, and Carl Bensk should still have returned home.<br>Life has never been proven to exist on Mars. Nevertheless, a variety of microscopic organisms could be flourishing in the planet's atmosphere and soil undetected. Our investigation of Mars is still in its infant stages. As is well known, a human being exposed to a virus or a bacteria from an alien environment would have no natural defense. Skeptics of this theory, however, point out that such an infection would have had to strike at lightning speed to prevent the cosmonauts from radioing Earth. Given the harsh Martian environment, advanced forms of life are considered impossible. Plus, of course, none of the Russians saw anything that looked alive. But even if such creatures did exist, they would once again have had to kill at an incredible speed to prevent at least a warning from being sent to Earth. Certainly, no alien's arm could have reached all the way into space and murdered Carl Bensk, not unless the alien was part of an advanced civilization that had mastered the art of invisibility.<br>It must be clear by now that the fundamental criticism of all these theories centers on Mr. Bensk. That is, except for the fifth theory--insanity. The Russians...<br>* * *<br>Lauren dropped the paper with a start as a loud explosion echoed across the lake. Daniel must have brought bullets, she thought. Terry must have arrived. She jumped to her feet and raced down the sandy beach. She ran fast, as hard as she had on the run out, and was gasping for air by the time she caught sight of Jennifer and her friend.<br>But Terry hadn't arrived, after all. Daniel was simply target shooting, using the cans of Coke she had bought yesterday. A handsome boy, he was dark complexioned, and had a remarkably well developed physique for a fourteen-year-old. The rifle he had cocked to his shoulder looked as if it could blow the head off a dinosaur.<br>"I told him you would come if he shot the gun," Jennifer said with a laugh. "Lauren, this is Daniel. Daniel, this is my big sister, Lauren. She's going to Mars in a couple of weeks."<br><i>So what else is new</i>, Lauren thought.<br>Daniel offered his hand. "I know that. I saw you on TV last week. That's great that you're going to Mars. I'd like to go there myself someday."<br>Lauren shook his hand. "Pleased to meet you, Daniel. You'll get to go. In another twenty years they'll probably have tourist flights to Mars."<br>"But Lauren's going to be one of the first there," Jennifer said.<br>"The Russians were the first ones," Daniel said. He added, "Of course, they didn't come back."<br>"No they didn't," Lauren agreed.<br>"That was a lousy way for me to say hello," Daniel said wisely. "Sorry."<br>"That's all right," Lauren said.<br>"It's pretty cold there, isn't it?" Daniel asked.<br>"Our suits will keep us warm," Lauren said. "At least, that's what NASA tells us."<br>"I tried on her helmer," Jennifer broke in.<br>"What was it like?" Daniel asked, interested.<br>"It didn't fit. It was like wearing a bowl over your head. It was fun, though."<br>"We'll see you on TV when you're there, won't we?" Daniel asked.<br>"Yes," Lauren said. "Except you'll see everything twenty minutes after it happens. Even traveling at the speed of light, out radio signals will take that long to reach Earth. You probably know all that stuff."<br>"Yeah," Daniel said. "Pretty long ways to travel. Jenny says yo...</p><h2>Minnesota &amp; Wisconsin Month-by-Month Gardening: What to Do Each Month to Have A Beautiful Garden All Year</h2><p>Never garden alone!

In this richly detailed and engaging history, Lizzie Collingham establishes how control of food and its production is crucial to total war. How were the imperial ambitions of Germany and Japan - ambitions which sowed the seeds of war - informed by a desire for self-sufficiency in food production? How was the outcome of the war affected by the decisions that the Allies and the Axis took over how to feed their troops? And how did the distinctive ideologies of the different combatant countries determine their attitudes towards those they had to feed?<p>Tracing the interaction between food and strategy, on both the military and home fronts, this gripping, original account demonstrates how the issue of access to food was a driving force within Nazi policy and contributed to the decision to murder hundreds of thousands of 'useless eaters' in Europe. Focusing on both the winners and losers in the battle for food, <i>The Taste of War</i> brings to light the striking fact that war-related hunger and famine was not only caused by Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan, but was also the result of Allied mismanagement and neglect, particularly in India, Africa and China.</p><p>American dominance both during and after the war was not only a result of the United States' immense industrial production but also of its abundance of food. This book traces the establishment of a global pattern of food production and distribution and shows how the war subsequently promoted the pervasive influence of American food habits and tastes in the post-war world.

One-dish meals are perennially popular on American tables, and books devoted to one-dish cooking perform well. Robin Robertson&#39;s One-Dish Vegan is the first book at the intersection of these two powerful cookbook categories. Robin Robertson has built a publishing record of very successful titles in the vegetarian category. She is known for her creativity in the kitchen, for the breadth of enticing ingredients and flavors with which she works, and for her expertise in vegetarian nutrition - with a special focus lately on how vegans still can get enough protein in their diets. Typically, it takes two or three courses or dishes to make a well-rounded vegan meal. To meet this criterion in one dish takes the kind of ingenuity and expert knowledge that Robertson possesses. One-Dish Vegan contains more than 150 recipes. They range from the most popular categories of one-dish dining like stews, chilis, and casseroles (and other baked dishes) to a host of stovetop sautés and stir-fries as well as substantial salads and dishes that feature pasta as well as other noodles, such as Asian noodles. The recipes are at once homey and adventuresome, comforting and surprising. Above all, they demonstrate that it really is possible to get a complete vegan meal into one dish, full of good-for-you nutrients and bright, satisfying flavors.</p><p><p><b>Robin Robertson </b>is a veteran restaurant chef, cooking teacher, and an acclaimed writer. She pens a regular column for <i>VegNews</i> magazine and has written for <i>Vegetarian Times</i>, Health Naturally, <i>Restaurant Business</i>, <i>National Culinary Review</i>, <i>American Culinary Federation </i>magazine, and<i> Better Nutrition</i>. She has written numerous cookbooks, including the best-selling titles <i>Vegan Planet</i>, <i>Vegan on the Cheap</i>, and <i>Quick-Fix Vegan</i>. Robertson currently writes, promotes her books, and teaches classes on her innovative vegan cuisine from her home in the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia. Her website is robinrobertson.com.</p>Vegans have just as much need for soups and casseroles as any other eaters, dishes a cook can prepare ahead and that can serve for lunches at desks, for fast leftover meals, and for freezing against another day&#x2019;s dinner. Robertson exhibits imagination and experience in her recipes&#x2019; design and execution. As do so many expert cooks, Robertson commences with stock&#x2014;in this case, simple vegetable stock, which can add lots of flavor to many different dishes, not just to soups. Ethnic cuisines contribute intriguing variations on lasagna and even popular pad Thai. She devotes an entire chapter to chili. Certain ingredients appear frequently, especially chickpeas. But Robertson covers plenty of other beans and similar protein sources to help ensure balanced nutrition. Specialty items, such as nutritional yeast, appear sparingly. Those with particular food sensitivities will appreciate her noting which recipes avoid allergens like gluten and soy. --Mark Knoblauch</p><h2>Great Space Battles</h2><p>Efforts by the Terran Federation to protect the homeworld and establish colonies throughout the galaxy are evidenced in a chronicle of the Laguna Wars, the Great Rebellion, and the struggle against the pirates of Capella</p><p></p><h2>Outsiders: Studies In The Sociology Of Deviance</h2><p>One of the most groundbreaking sociology texts of the mid-20th century, Howard S.

Whether it walks, talks, flies, or barks, Elizabite is ready to make a meal of it. Her cheerful, hungry smile and infinite appetite attract much attention - a scientist examines her, a professor studies her, and everyone agrees that she is one of a kind. In an effort to control her diet and her unpredictable temper, Elizabite&#39;s admirers chain and muzzle her. But not even a barbed wire fence can prevent her from following her heart&#39;s (and stomach&#39;s) desire! Only when her unique appetite prevents a crime does Elizabite win the respect she deserves. The story of Elizabite, written more than fifty years ago, keeps company with those of Curious George, Spotty, and others in the Reys&#39; memorable cast of characters. Perhaps less well known than her compatriots, but equally well loved, Elizabite teaches the value of being oneself.</p><p>Hans Augusto Rey was born in Hamburg, Germany in 1898. As a child, he spent much of his free time in that city&#39;s famous Hagenbeck Zoo drawing animals. After serving in the army during World War I, he studied philology and natural science at the University of Hamburg. He then married Margret Rey and they moved to Montmartre for four years. The manuscript for the first Curious George books was one of the few items the Reys carried with them on their bicycles when they escaped from Paris in 1940. Eventually, they made their way to the United States, and Curious George was published in 1941. Curious George has been published in many languages, including French, German, Japanese, Afrikaans, and Norwegian. Additional Curious George books followed, as well as such other favorites as CECILY G. AND THE NINE MONKEYS and FIND THE CONSTELLATIONS.Kindergarten-Grade 3-Since her debut in 1942, Elizabite, the carnivorous plant, has maintained her appeal and popularity with very young readers. Elizabite, created by H.A. Rey, author of Curious George, is a unique carnivorous plant who devours whatever encroaches within her space. A barbed wire fence doesn't even impede her eating. She finally earns a place of honor in the local zoo after becoming a real heroine. With exciting musical accompaniment and expressive reading, the written story takes on an added dimension of spirit, suspense, and stimulation. Listeners will identify with Elizabite, and scream with delight when Scotty loses his tail and cheer when the burglar is caught. The reading is spirited and at a pace specifically geared to fledgling readers. The rhyming format of the story intensifies a melodious tone and helps children to read, comprehend, and enjoy the story. Youngsters who experience some difficulty in reading and those whose native language is not English will benefit greatly from both oral and written presentations. For all elementary school library media centers and public library collections, this read-along program will be a valuable asset.<br><i>Patricia Mahoney Brown, Benjamin Franklin Elementary School, Kenmore, NY </i><br>Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Before I Made History: Lead Us to Freedom, Harriet Tubman!</h2><p>Book by Peter And Connie Roop</p><p></p><h2>Modern Hospitality: Simple Recipes with Southern Charm</h2><p>Known by TV viewers as the Mississippi belle whose demure demeanor belied nerves of steel and true culinary skill, America watched Whitney Miller crush the competition and become the first winner of <i>MasterChef</i> Season 1.

Just as his hand touched the doorknob, Grandma Strahan would say, "John, have you eaten breakfast?"

In my version of this breakfast staple, I've created granola tart shells that can easily be prepared ahead of time for entertaining at brunch or lunch. The presentation makes this easy-to-assemble dish feel like something special.<br><br>2 cups old-fashioned rolled oats 6 tablespoons light brown sugar 6 tablespoons chopped pecans 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/4 teaspoon salt 6 tablespoons cane syrup or maple syrup 4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) unsalted butter, melted 2 cups strawberries, sliced 1 1/3 cup blueberries 2 large bananas, sliced 1 1/2 cups whole-milk plain yogurt 2 teaspoons honey (optional) 1 tablespoon grated orange zest<br><br>Preheat the oven to 325�F.<br><br>Combine the oats, brown sugar, pecans, cinnamon, salt, syrup, and butter in a medium bowl.

The art of biscuit making was passed down through generations in my family. These biscuits have the perfect texture--flaky and delicate, with a crunchy bottom. They're delicious for breakfast with sweet syrup and can be paired with gravy for a satisfying, savory dish. My mom likes to enjoy her biscuits with softened butter and cane syrup mixed together!<br><br>1 cup self-rising flour 2 tablespoons butter-flavored shortening, chilled 1/3 cup whole milk 1 tablespoon canola oil 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted Softened butter and cane syrup, for serving<br><br>Preheat the oven to 425�F.<br><br>Place the flour in a medium bowl. Using a pastry cutter or a fork, cut the shortening into the flour. Stir in the milk until incorporated. Lightly flour your hands and form the dough into a ball. Divide the dough into 4 portions. Form each portion into a smooth ball by rolling it between your palms 5 times. Tuck any rough edges into the top of the ball. Roll between your hands 10 more times to form a smooth ball. Repeat with the other 3 portions.<br><br>Grease a cast-iron griddle with the oil. Place a dough ball, smoother side down, in the pan to coat with oil and flip over so that the smooth side is facing up. With three fingers, press the dough down a bit, making a slight indention on the top of each biscuit.<br><br>Bake until golden brown, 16 to 18 minutes. Remove from the oven and brush the tops of the warm biscuits with the melted butter.<br><br>Serve the biscuits warm with softened butter and cane syrup.<br><br>Makes 4 biscuits<br><br>Breakfast Grit Cakes<br><br>In the South, grits are traditionally prepared on the stovetop with butter, salt, and pepper. In this recipe, cooked grits are transformed into cakes that serve as a base for eggs, bacon, and cheese. But you can top these simple little cakes with anything you'd like. If you're serving breakfast for a crowd, simply set out a platter of grits cakes alongside bowls of toppings and let your guests assemble their own creations.<br><br>2 1/3 cups water 1 cup quick-cooking grits 5 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 teaspoon salt 1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper 1/3 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional) 1/3 cup all-purpose flour Dad's Scrambled Eggs (page 13) 5 slices bacon, cooked and crumbled 1/4 cup sliced grape tomatoes 3/4 cup shredded sharp Cheddar cheese 2 tablespoons sliced scallions<br><br>Bring 2 1/3 cups water to a boil in a medium saucepan over high heat. Stir in the grits, reduce the heat to low, and cook, stirring occasionally, until grits reach porridge consistency, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in 2 tablespoons of the butter, the salt, black pepper, and cayenne (if using).<br><br>Line a pizza pan or small rimmed baking sheet with plastic wrap. Pour the grits in the center of the pan. Using a spatula, spread the grits evenly to a thickness of 3/8 inch. Let cool until the grits are set, about 30 minutes.<br><br>Using a 3-inch round cookie or biscuit cutter, cut out 12 circles from the cooled grits. Dredge both sides of the grits cakes in flour.<br><br>Heat a large cast-iron pan over medium-high heat. Melt 2 tablespoons of the butter in the pan swirl to coat the bottom. Working with half the cakes at a time, cook until lightly browned, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes per side. Carefully remove with a spatula and drain on a paper towel-lined baking sheet. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon butter to the pan and cook the remaining cakes.<br><br>Preheat the broiler. Line a broiler pan with foil.<br><br>Place the cakes on the broiler pan.

Lightly coat four 8-ounce ramekins with cooking spray and place on a baking sheet.<br><br>To make the biscuit crust: Place the flour in a medium bowl. Using a pastry cutter or fork, cut the shortening into the flour. Stir in the rosemary and buttermilk until incorporated. Flour your hands and lightly form the dough into a ball. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 10 minutes.<br><br>Sprinkle flour over a clean surface. Roll the dough out to a 1/4-inch-thick round.

Evenly distribute the egg mixture among the ramekins.<br><br>Coat the rims of the ramekins with a little bit of the melted butter to help the biscuit crust stick. Place the biscuit dough rounds onto the tops of the ramekins and gently press the dough onto the rims and against the sides. Brush the tops of the crusts with the remaining melted butter.<br><br>Bake until the crust is golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes.

Everyone gets in the kitchen and cooks his or her specialty and then we have an evening breakfast feast! My mom and I team up and make biscuits and andouille gravy (see the gravy that goes with the Creamy Mashed Potatoes on page 75). My dad always makes his famous scrambled eggs. His technique produces such fluffy eggs that I like to call these "pillows-in-your-mouth."<br><br>5 large eggs 1/4 teaspoon salt 1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper<br><br>Whisk the eggs and 2 tablespoons water in a medium bowl until combined. Whisk in the salt and pepper.<br><br>Coat the bottom of a 12-inch nonstick skillet with cooking spray and heat over medium-high heat. Pour in the egg mixture. Cook, without stirring, until bubbles begin to form, 30 seconds to 1 minute. When bubbles begin to form, gently scrape the outer edges of the pan with a silicone spatula to bring the egg mixture into the center. Cook for 2 minutes, continuing to fold the egg mixture into the center of the pan, forming large, long curds. If eggs begin to cook too quickly, remove the pan from the heat and allow to finish cooking in the hot pan. The eggs should be light, fluffy, and still moist.<br><br>Serves 4</p><h2>The Horse You Came in On</h2><p>Mourning the death of his lover, Scotland yard Superintendent Richard Jury throws himself into a new case involving three seemingly unrelated murders and a literary forgery in Baltimore, Maryland</p><p>ate and entertaining . . .

Now, with <i>Spell It Out</i>, he takes on the task of answering all the questions about how we spell: "Why is English spelling so difficult?" Or "Why are good spellers so proud of their achievement that when they see a misspelling they condemn the writer as sloppy, lazy, or uneducated?" In thirty-seven short, engaging and informative chapters, Crystal takes readers on a history of English spelling, starting with the Roman missionaries' sixth century introduction of the Roman alphabet and ending with where the language might be going. He looks individually at each letter in the alphabet and its origins. He considers the question of vowels and how people developed a way to tell whether or not it was long or short. He looks at influences from other cultures, and explains how English speakers understood that the "o" in "hopping" was a short vowel, rather than the long vowel of "hoping". If you've ever asked yourself questions like "Why do the words "their", "there" and "they're" sound alike, but mean very different things?" or "How can we tell the difference between "charge" the verb and "charge" the noun?" David Crystal's <i>Spell It Out</i> will spell it all out for you.</p></p><p><p>DAVID CRYSTAL is the author of <i>The Story of English in 100 Words</i> and Honorary Professor of Linguistics at the University of Wales, Bangor. In 1995, he was awarded the Order of the British Empire for services to the English language. He lives in the United Kingdom.</p>Crystal makes a compelling case that spelling can be an adventure. This whirlwind review of the history of English spelling contains helpful tips for average readers and teachers, with small gems of discovery every few pages. The development of our language was influenced by everything from efficiency to fashion, such as the sixteenth-century love of Latin spelling. His brisk approach takes about as many chapters as there are English sounds&#x2014;a bit more than 26&#x2014;which are the root of several spelling variations. Writers&#x2019; knotty and convoluted efforts to bring order to this hodgepodge are often doomed, as the myriad exceptions to &#x201c;i before e&#x201d; demonstrate. Although his book is not exactly a love letter to the vagaries of English, linguist Crystal (The Story of English in 100 Words, 2012) maintains an affectionate tone of indulgence, similar to how a doting relative would treat a wayward nephew. For as Crystal shows, spelling is a cultural legacy as human&#x2014;and therefore as prone to mischief&#x2014;as anything else we create. --Bridget Thoreson</p><h2>Precalculus Solutions Manual</h2><p>unused clean copy!</p><p></p><h2>Twenties Girl</h2><p>Lara Lington has always had an overactive imagination, but suddenly that imagination seems to be in overdrive. Normal professional twenty-something young women don&#x2019;t get visited by ghosts. Or do they?<br><br>When the spirit of Lara&#x2019;s great-aunt Sadie&#x2013;a feisty, demanding girl with firm ideas about fashion, love, and the right way to dance&#x2013;mysteriously appears, she has one last request: Lara must find a missing necklace that had been in Sadie&#x2019;s possession for more than seventy-five years, and Sadie cannot rest without it. Lara, on the other hand, has a number of ongoing distractions. Her best friend and business partner has run off to Goa, her start-up company is floundering, and she&#x2019;s just been dumped by the &#x201c;perfect&#x201d; man.<br><br>Sadie, however, could care less.<br><br>Lara and Sadie make a hilarious sparring duo, and at first it seems as though they have nothing in common. But as the mission to find Sadie&#x2019;s necklace leads to intrigue and a new romance for Lara, these very different &#x201c;twenties&#x201d; girls learn some surprising truths from each other along the way. Written with all the irrepressible charm and humor that have made Sophie Kinsella&#x2019;s books beloved by millions, <i>Twenties Girl </i>is also a deeply moving testament to the transcendent bonds of friendship and family.</p><p><strong>Amazon Exclusive: Sophie Kinsella on <em>Twenties Girl</em></strong> <br> <br> <strong>Sophie Kinsella is a former financial journalist and the author of the best-selling novels <em>Confessions of a Shopaholic</em>, <em>Shopaholic Takes Manhattan</em>, <em>Shopaholic Ties the Knot</em>, <em>Shopaholic &amp; Sister</em>, <em>Shopaholic &amp; Baby</em>, <em>Can You Keep a Secret?</em>, <em>The Undomestic Goddess</em>, and <em>Remember Me?</em>. She lives in England, where she is at work on her next book.</strong> <br> <p> Writing <em>Twenties Girl</em> was like going on my own magical mystery tour. My U.S. editor Susan Kamil had once said casually, "You should write a ghost story one day." This comment stayed with me for years. I loved the idea, but didn't know who my ghost could be. I've always loved the glamour and spirit of the 1920s, and the idea came to me of a flapper ghost. A feisty, fun, glamorous girl who adored to dance and drink cocktails and get her own way. I wanted her to be a determined character who would blast into the life of someone with no warning and cause havoc. I then decided she should haunt a thoroughly modern girl, with all the culture clashes and comedy that would bring.<br></p> <p>Having come up with this idea I loved it, so it then remained to plunge myself into 1920s research, which was no hardship at all, as I find the era fascinating. I researched vintage make-up, vintage dresses, read fiction from the period, investigated 1920s slang, and tried to channel as much I could of those feisty flappers who cut their hair short (shock!), smoked cigarettes in public (shock!), had sex (shock!) and generally rebelled in all the outrageous ways they could.</p> <p>The book isn't a period piece though. It's a modern story about two girls and their sparky friendship, right here in the 21st century. One of them just happens to be a ghost from the 1920s. It's a quest, a romance, and a coming of age... and above all a comedy. It's no exaggeration to say that writing the character of Sadie made me look at life differently, and I hope some readers feel the same way. <em>&#x2014;Sophie Kinsella</em></p> <strong>Sophie Kinsella on Jewelry in <em>Twenties Girl</em></strong> <p>When I was at college I had a bicycle which I rarely used and which sat, week after week, in the bike racks. One day I went to get it out--and found a diamante necklace twined round the spokes of the front wheel. It was an old, vintage-style necklace, one of the prettiest things I&#x2019;d ever seen. On my bike! How had it got there? Had someone borrowed my bike and dropped it? Was it a romantic gift from a secret admirer? (Ok, unlikely...)</p> <p>I put up a notice in college--but got no claimers. It was mine! I wore that necklace over and over--and felt as though it had somehow magical qualities. Would it have felt so magical if it were a scarf or a hat or a purse? I don&#x2019;t think so.</p> <p>Jewelry has a magic all its own. Precious stones have always attracted legends, myths, crimes, lust. Quite sane women will go to pieces at the sight of a big enough diamond. Even as a tiny child I was fascinated by beads, jewels, tiaras...anything that glittered. And, like books, I find it hard to give pieces of jewelry away, even after I&#x2019;ve stopped wearing them.</p> <p>The biggest symbol of jewelry is love. Whose heart doesn&#x2019;t stop on being presented with a little velvet box? Who secretly doesn&#x2019;t crave a diamond, however teeny? Of course true love is putting out the rubbish every night...but that won&#x2019;t make you gasp and tilt your hand to catch the facets of light.</p> <p>When I was writing <i>Twenties Girl</i> I knew I needed to give Sadie, my ghost character, a mission. There was something in the world she still wanted--and it didn&#x2019;t take long to decide on jewelry. A ring seemed too obvious...bracelets too inconsequential...but a necklace was perfect. I wanted it to be tactile, romantic, and the kind of piece you could imagine wearing with anything. Guided by research into jewelry of the 1920s, I conjured up in my head a long necklace of glimmering yellow glass beads, with a dragonfly pendant set with rhinestones. Not priceless....but special. I could imagine Sadie twirling the beads as she danced, I could imagine her gathering them and letting them drop. I could see it as an iconic, timeless piece. </p> <p>A dragonfly seemed a perfect emblem for Sadie, too--beautiful, fragile, and darting around like quicksilver. The dragonfly symbol has different meanings for different cultures--for some it&#x2019;s a symbol of change, for others it represents the subconscious. In Japanese paintings, dragonflies can mean new light and joy. To some Native Americans they&#x2019;re the souls of the dead. All of these interpretations are perfect for the character of Sadie--a ghost who needs to "move on" and for whom the dragonfly necklace has a meaning all its own.</p> <p>The more I wrote about Sadie&#x2019;s dragonfly necklace the more it came to mean to both her and me--and I hope it does to readers, too.</p>Sophie Kinsella is the author of the bestselling Shopaholic series as well as <i>The Undomestic Goddess, Can You Keep a Secret?</i>, and <i>Remember Me?</i> She lives in England.</p><h2>Kurt Warner: And the Last Shall Be First</h2><p>Kurt Warner is the greatest rag-to-riches story in the history of sports.

Activist and rabble-rouser Larry Kramer has the distinction of having written not only one of the earliest and best-known plays on AIDS, <i>The Normal Heart</i>, but also the astonishing satire of gay urban sexual mores <i>Faggots</i>, perhaps the most reviled novel in the gay literary canon. A grim, graphic expansion on John Rechy's <i>Numbers</i>, which chronicled a hustler's soulless game of sexual conquest, Kramer's pornopticon turns off many readers by about page 3, when its hero, the screenwriter Fred Lemish, is offered an array of dubious pleasures in a private room at the infamous Everard Baths in New York. What Lemish really wants, of course, is true love, preferably from his elusive boyfriend, Dinky Adams. But as long as he's in the room...<p> Celebrated and excoriated when it first appeared in 1978, this reprint of a gay anticlassic is not for the faint of heart. For the rest of us, it is a harsh, fascinating, and somewhat eerie revisitation of the carnal excesses of a generation that couldn't hear the bell tolling over the disco beat.</p>Graphically sexual and one of the all-time best-selling gay novels, Faggots is the story of Fred Lemish, who at thirty-nine has built up his body into a fatless state of being in Great Shape. Lemish is ready to find Mr. Right. But from the Everhard Baths to the Pines on Fire Island to that place of myth and story, The Meat Rack, he is looking for his dream lover in all the wrong places. Faggots is a fierce satire of the gay ghetto and a touching story of one man's desperate search for permanence, commitment, and love. <p>"A Vesuvian explosion about the gay life that spares no one and no thing...there is much truth and honesty to be found here."--Seymour Krim, Chicago Tribune </p><p>"True comic brilliance--a vicious Swiftian satire that, like all satire, contains a strong moral voice."--New York </p><p>"Faggots, for all its excesses, is frequently right on target and, when it is on target, is appallingly funny."--Edward Albee </p><p>"Larry Kramer has more than come out of the closet, he's housecleaned the neighborhood. Faggots is a novel of courage...a journey worth the chronicle...a noble gesture."--Baltimore Sun </p><p>"Larry Kramer is one of America's most valuable troublemakers. I hope he never lowers his voice."--Susan Sontag </p><p>"The liberation of sexuality from the bonds of moralism has left in its wake a crying need for principled, intelligent, vigorous explorations of how a genuine morality can be introduced to our newly minted freedom. This exploration is a central part of Kramer's historically significant literary work, of which Faggots constitutes an important beginning and a key. As a documentation of an era, as savage and savagely funny social parody, as a cry in the wilderness, and as a prescient, accurate reading of the writing on the wall, the novel is peerless and utterly necessary. It is brilliant, bellicose, contemptuous, compassionate and--as is true of everything Kramer writes--behind its delectable, entertaining, sometimes maddening harshness is a profoundly moving plea for justice and for love. There are few books in modern gay fiction, or modern fiction for that matter, that must be read. Faggots is certainly one of them."--Tony Kushner </p><p>"Since his screenplay for D. H. Lawrence's Women in Love in 1969, Larry Kramer has been a prophet of psychic health and catastrophe among us--a prophet unmatched for the accuracy of his omens and the reliability of his anathemas and remedies. His uncannily foresighted novel Faggots appeared in 1978 just as the AIDS virus flooded whole wings of the American bloodstream; now its Swiftian portrait of an all but vanished subculture stands as that culture's visible memorial. His later plays have been clear as firebells, memorable as tracer bullets."--The American Academy of Arts and Letters citation, May 1996 </p><p>"[Faggots] sends up New York's self-imposed gay ghetto, doing for its gyms, discos, orgy rooms, army fatigues, mustaches, and advertising agencies what Portnoy's Complaint did for Mom and masturbation. Faggots is the Uncle Tom's Cabin for homosexual men whose worst oppression is their lack of courage to change the way they live."--Library Journal </p><p>"A corrosive study of the gay underbelly of New York.... Faggots has the air of a Restoration comedy in its mix of Baroque style and bawdy, scathing humor."--Women's Wear Daily </p><p>"A book of major historical importance--the first contemporary novel to chronicle gay life with unsparing honesty and wild humor. Larry Kramer has changed the way we think about gay men. He is one of our great humanists."--Erica Jong </p><p>"Writing as always from an affirmatively homosexual point of view, Kramer in this novel conveys a sense of premonitory unease, even foreboding, about the spread of promiscuity, sadomasochism and narcotics among the homosexual population...more graphic than James Baldwin or Hubert Selby."--Times Literary Supplement </p><p>"It would come to resemble her, Picasso said of his Stein portrait-and so with Kramer's of New York gay life, which I had thought so entertaining, so extravagant, ever so preposterous a lustrum ago. It has come to resemble it, in tr</p></p><h2>A Gathering of Days: A New England Girl&#39;s Journal, 1830-32</h2><p>The journal of a fourteen-year-old girl, kept the last year she lived on the family farm, records daily events in her small New Hampshire town, her father&#39;s remarriage, and the death of her best friend.</p><p></p><h2>Chopin (Famous Children Series)</h2><p>Frederic Chopin was born in Poland-a land far from Paris, London and Vienna, the music capitals of Europe.

Alianne is the teenage daughter of the famed Alanna, the first lady knight in Tortall. Young Aly follows in the quieter footsteps of her father, however, delighting in the art of spying. When she is captured and sold as a slave to an exiled royal family in the faraway Copper Islands, it is this skill that makes a difference in a world filled with political intrigue, murderous conspiracy, and warring gods. This is the first of two books featuring Alianne.</p><p>To the great joy of her many fans, Tamora Pierce with this book begins a new saga of Tortall to add to The Song of the Lioness Quartet, the Immortals Quartet, and The Protector of the Small tetralogy. At the center of each of these books is always a strong and resourceful young woman who masters the arts of swordplay and knightly warfare in the magical medieval country of Tortall. Alianne, or Aly, daughter of the warrior queen Alanna the Lioness, has all these skills, but also a delicious sense of humor, which serves her well when she is chosen by the trickster god Kyprioth to serve as his secret agent and a slave for a year in the embattled Copper Isles. There the dark-skinned natives, or raka, have been conquered and crushed by the laurin, light-skinned people from the mainland. The burning raka resentment is fueled by prophecies of a twice royal queen who will free them, aided by the "wise one, the cunning one, the strong one, the warrior, and the crows." Just how each of the colorful characters and Aly herself fit into this prophecy and Kyprioth&#x2019;s tricky plan keeps readers guessing. Aly plots to show her skill at spying as she flirts with the god and is courted by Nawat, a crow transformed into a handsome young man, who is puzzled when she rejects his attempts to mate-feed her with grubs and ants. <p> The pages of this long but fast-paced adventure zip by, enlivened by intrigue, skirmishes, comedy, romance, and lots of dramatic clothes.

Each morning, he checked and balanced his scales, and he took great care to give his customers exactly what they paid for -- not more and not less.&nbsp;&nbsp;Van Amsterdam's shop was always busy, because people trusted him, and because he was a good baker as well. And never was the shop busier than in the days before December 6, when the Dutch celebrate Saint Nicholas Day.&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time of year, people flocked to the baker's shop to buy his fine Saint Nicholas cookies. Made of gingerbread, iced in red and white, they looked just like Saint Nicholas as the Dutch know him -- tall and thin, with a high, red bishop's cap, and a long, red bishop's cloak.&nbsp;&nbsp;One Saint Nicholas Day morning, the baker was just ready for business, when the door of his shop flew open. In walked an old woman, wrapped in a long black shawl.&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have come for a dozen of your Saint Nicholas cookies."&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking a tray, Van Amsterdam counted out twelve cookies. He started to wrap them, but the woman reached out and stopped him.&nbsp;&nbsp;"I asked for a dozen. You have given me only twelve."&nbsp;&nbsp;"Madam," said the baker, "everyone knows that a dozen is twelve."&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I say a dozen is thirteen," said the woman. "Give me one more."&nbsp;&nbsp;Van Amsterdam was not a man to bear foolishness. "Madam, my customers get exactly what they pay for -- not more and not less."&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then you may keep the cookies."&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman turned to go, but stopped at the door.&nbsp;&nbsp;"Van Amsterdam! However honest you may be, your heart is small and your fist is tight.

Today's society is shaped by unprecedented growth in the number of people living in their "golden years", shifting patterns of work and home life, and advances in health care that offer the promise of longer, more active lives. In this fascinating, life-affirming book, Dr. Gene Cohen debunks harmful myths about aging and illuminates the biological and emotional foundations of creativity. He shoes how the unique combination of age, experience, and creativity can produce exciting inner growth and infinite potential for everyone. Interweaving history, scientific research, inspiring true-life stories, and his own fresh insights, Dr. Cohen takes us into the previously uncharted territory of human potential in the "second half" of life.</p><p>Discover the owners of the Creative Age:</p><ul><li>We can actually increase the number of essential connections among brain cells including those for memory and response. </li><li> Many sleep and mood disorders can be eliminated by stimulating the brain; sleep problems are not an inevitable part of aging or decline in brain function</li><li>Vocabulary expands well into the eighties among people who continue to challenge themselves intellectually through reading, writing, and word games -- having difficulty finding the right word is not inevitable </li><li>Capitalizing on our creativity, and having a positive outlook and sense of well-being, boosts our immune systems. </li></ul><p></p></p><p><p>Gene D.

It has uplifted lives in every civilization and every era, from dirt playgrounds to marble palaces. It has survived catastrophic acts of inhumanity, ignorance, and apathy, to bloom in the darkest days as well as the brightest hours of human existence. It has illuminated our lives with flashes of singular brilliance in advances in human understanding and in the softer, warmer light of words or deeds that daily enrich the human experience.</p><p>Each one of us is endowed with the spirit of creativity, whether we recognize it or not. We see it easily in the young child who turns a bed into a sailing ship and pillows into fortresses. We readily admire it in the brilliant pianist or determined inventor. We celebrate it in the ingenious efforts of survival by those caught in the path of nature's fury or the storms of war and other human cruelty. But we tend to overlook the same creative energy when, transformed by age and experience, it leads a retired chemist to become an education activist, or prompts a once travel-shy homemaker to take her first vacation abroad. Creative potential is there in all of us, an inner resource, renewable and vibrant, no matter how much or how little it is used. This creative spirit has the power to change our lives at every age, and to do so in quite different ways as we get older.</p><p>Playwright George Bernard Shaw believed in lifelong creativity. He espoused this belief in his writing, reflected in the chapter's opening quote, and he practiced it throughout his lifetime. Despite adversity in the earlier days of his writing career, Shaw persevered. He wrote <i>Back to Methuselah</i> when he was sixty-six, and was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1925, at the age of sixty-nine. He continued to write for more than two decades and was at work on a comedy when he died at age ninety-four.</p><p>Shaw's contribution to literature is of historic measure, and not only for the pleasure of scholars. Like so many products of the creative spirit, his ideas found new expression in the lives of others. Years after the playwright died, when Sen. Robert Kennedy repeated Shaw's urging to "dream things that never were: and say, 'Why not?' " it was to inspire a new generation of creative social and political action that would, itself, earn a prominent place in history.</p><p>As we explore the powerful potential that creativity brings to us as we age, we can begin by posing Shaw's question anew. Each of us, in our own life, needs to dream things that have not happened for us and ask: "Why not?" After all, modern science and medicine have strengthened the foundations of life as we age. Preliminary research and evidence from life around us makes clear that creativity is a catalyst for change of the best kind, with benefits that are immediate, long-lasting, and within the reach of every person. Even more interesting is that as we age, some key ingredients for creativity--life experience and the long view-are only enhanced. In studies of aging people and in my work with them, four aspects of creativity stand out:</p><p>1. <i>Creativity strengthens our morale in later life.</i> Creativity allows us to alter our experience of problems, and sometimes to transcend them, in later life. Part of the nature of creativity is its engaging and sustaining quality--no matter what our actual physical condition, we feel better when we are able to view our circumstances with fresh perspective and express ourselves with some creativity. Creativity makes us more emotionally resilient and better able to cope with life's adversity and losses. Just as exercise improves our muscle tone, when we are creatively engaged, our emotional tone is elevated.</p><p>2. <i>Creativity contributes to physical health as we age.</i> Increasing numbers of preliminary findings from psychoneuroimmunological studies--research that examines the interaction of our emotions, our brain function, and our immune system--suggest that a positive outlook and a sense of well-being have a beneficial effect on the functioning of our immune system and our overall health. These findings are particularly strong among older persons.</p><p> Creative expression typically fosters feelings that can improve outlook and a sense of well-being. Just as chronic unrelieved stress has a detrimental effect on the immune system, continuing creativity, by promoting the expression of emotions, promotes an immune function boost.</p><p>3. <i>Creativity enriches relationships. </i>For young or middle-aged adults, knowing there is a potential for creativity in later life will improve their outlook and expectations of those years. Adult children with optimistic expectations of aging typically are more comfortable discussing issues of aging and other life passages with their parents. The effect is a boon for both generations: the younger adult learns first hand about achieving a more satisfying aging experience, and the older adult remains engaged in the circle of relationship and emotional intimacy that strengthens connections to others and richness of life.</p><p>4. <i>Creativity is our greatest legacy.</i> To be creative in later life provides an invaluable model of what is possible as we age, for our children, grandchildren, great grandchildren, and society. As a role model in your family or in the lives of others, you can shape individual thinking and societal policies about aging. Historically, creativity has distinguished elders as "keepers" of the culture, those who pass the history and values of family and community on to the next generation.</p><p>Most of us will never win the Nobel Peace Prize or a Presidential election, but we can use creativity to shape our lives and, especially as we age, to unleash new potential for personal growth and self-expression. Before we can fully access our creative potential in aging, we need to clear away the internal and external obstacles to understanding...</p></p><h2>Watercolor Free &amp; Easy</h2><p>Offers an introduction to the art of watercolor painting, discussing techniques, supplies, color, and learning from mistakes</p><p></p><h2>Sunset in St. Tropez</h2><p>In her 55th bestselling novel, Danielle Steel explores the seasons of an extraordinary friendship, weaving the story of three couples, lifelong friends, for whom a month&#x2019;s holiday in St. Tropez becomes a summer of change, revelation, secrets, surprises, and new beginnings . . . <br><br>As Diana Morrison laid the table for six at her elegant Central Park apartment, there was no warning of what was to come. Spending New Year&#x2019;s Eve together was a sacred tradition for Diana, her husband of thirty-two years, Eric, and their best friends, Pascale and John Donnally and Anne and Robert Smith. The future looked rosy as the long-time friends sipped champagne and talked of renting a villa together in the South of France the following summer. But life had other plans . . .<br><br>Just two weeks after New Year&#x2019;s, tragedy strikes the heart of their close circle, as Robert Smith suffers a sudden, unexpected loss. Without hesitation, Diana and Eric, Pascale and John rally to his side, united in their support, love, and shared grief. Convinced that a change of scenery is just what Robert needs, they urge him to join them on the Riviera in August. But as they soon discover, the ramshackle old mansion they rented in St. Tropez--sight unseen--is far different from the exquisite villa and sun-drenched gardens touted in the brochure. Cobwebs hang from the ceiling. Beds collapse beneath them. All while a would-be housekeeper in a leopard-skin bikini and six-inch heels sashays through the house with a trio of yapping poodles at her heels. But the biggest surprise of all is the woman Robert invites to the villa as his guest--a lovely, much-younger film actress with mile-long legs and a million-dollar smile. Diana and Pascale hate her on sight. But the men are dazzled. And amid the crumbling furniture and the glorious sunsets, the strained relationships and the acts of forgiveness, more surprises are in store for the villa&#x2019;s occupants. With the last days of summer fast approaching, each couple finds themselves changing in unexpected ways, as old wounds are healed, new love discovered, and miracles unfold...all beneath the dazzling sun of St. Tropez.<br><br>By turns wise and moving, heartbreaking and wickedly funny, Danielle Steel&#x2019;s new novel is about forgiving without forgetting, about the sorrow that shadows our lives and the hope that saves us. And it is about once-in-a-lifetime friendships . . .the kind that heal, sustain, and change us forever.</p><p>Danielle Steel has been hailed as one of the world&#x2019;s most popular authors with over 480 million copies of her novels sold.

She is also the author of <b>His Bright Light</b>, the story of her son Nick Traina&#x2019;s life and death.<b>Chapter 1<br><br></b>Diana Morrison lit the candles in her dining room, on a table set for six. The apartment was large and elegant, with a view of Central Park. Diana and Eric had lived there for nineteen of the thirty-two years they'd been married, and for most of those years their two daughters had lived there with them. Both girls had moved out only in the last few years, Samantha to an apartment of her own when she graduated from Brown, and Katherine when she got married five years before. They were good girls, bright and loving and fun, and despite the expected skirmishes with them in their teens, Diana got along with them extremely well, and she missed them, now that they'd grown up.<br><br>But she and Eric had enjoyed their time alone. At fifty-five, she was still beautiful, and Eric had always been careful to keep the romance fresh between them. He heard enough stories through his work to understand what women needed from their men. At sixty, he was a handsome, youthful-looking man, and a year before he had talked Diana into getting her eyes done. He knew she would feel better if she did. And he'd been right, as she checked the table again that she had set for New Year's Eve, she looked glorious in the candlelight. The minor cosmetic surgery she'd had, had knocked ten years off her age.<br><br>She had let her hair go white years before, and it shimmered like fresh snow in a well-cut, angled bob that showed off her delicate features and big blue eyes. Eric always told her that she was as pretty as she'd been when they met. She'd been a nurse at Columbia-Presbyterian, when he was an obstetrical resident, and they'd gotten married six months later, and been together ever since. She'd stopped working when she got pregnant with Katherine, and stayed home after that, busy with the girls, and understanding with Eric as he got up night after night, to deliver babies. He loved his work, and she was proud of him.<br><br>He had one of the most successful ob/gyn practices in New York, and he said he wasn't tired of it yet, although two of his partners had retired the year before. But Eric still didn't mind the hours, and Diana was used to it by now. It didn't bother her when he left in the middle of the night, or had to cancel out of dinner parties at the last minute. They'd been living that way for more than thirty years. He worked on holidays and weekends, and loved what he did. He had been there with their daughter Katherine when both of her boys were born.<br><br>They were the perfect family in many ways, and life had been good to them. Theirs was an easy, fulfilling life, and a solid marriage. Diana kept busy now that the girls were grown, doing volunteer work at Sloan-Kettering, and organizing fund-raisers for research. She had no desire to go back to nursing once the girls grew up, and she knew she'd been out of it for too long. Besides, she had other interests now, her life had grown by leaps and bounds around her. Her charity work, the time she spent with Eric, their many interests, their trips, and her two grandsons filled her days.<br><br>As she stood in the dining room, she turned as she heard Eric walk into the living room, and for an instant, he stood in the doorway of the dining room, smiling at her, as their eyes met. The bond between them was evident, the solidity of their marriage rare.<br><br>"Good evening, Mrs. Morrison . . . you look incredible." His eyes said it even before his words did. It was always easy to see, and to know, how much he loved her. He had a handsome, boyish face, strong features, a cleft chin, eyes the same bright blue as her own, and his hair had drifted effortlessly from sandy blond to gray. He looked particularly handsome in his dinner jacket, he was trim, and in good shape, with the same narrow waist and broad shoulders he had had when they got married. He rode a bike in the park on Sunday afternoons, and played tennis whenever he wasn't on call on the weekend. And he either played squash or swam, no matter how tired he was, every night when he finished at the office. The two of them looked like an ad for healthy, attractive middle-aged people. "Happy New Year, sweetheart," he added as he walked over, put an arm around her, and kissed her. "What time are they coming?" "They" referred to the two couples who were their favorite companions and best friends.<br><br>"At eight," she said, as she checked the champagne cooling in a silver bucket, and he poured himself a martini. "Or at least Robert and Anne will. Pascale and John should be here sometime before midnight." He laughed as he dropped an extra olive in his glass and glanced at Diana.<br><br>Eric and John Donnally had gone to Harvard together, and been friends ever since. They were as different as night and day. Eric was tall and lean, easygoing, open, and generous of spirit. He loved women, and as he did every day in his practice, he could spend hours talking to them. John was stocky, powerful, irascible, ornery, argued constantly with his wife, and pretended to have a roving eye, although no one had ever actually seen him do anything about it. And in truth, John loved his wife, although he would rather have died than admit it publicly, even among his closest friends. Listening to him and Pascale talk was like hearing a series of rapid-fire explosions. She was as volatile as he was, and eight years younger than Diana. Pascale was French and had been dancing with the New York City Ballet when John met her. She was twenty-two years old when they met, and twenty-five years later, she was as tiny and graceful as she had been then, with big green eyes, dark brown hair, and an incredible figure. She had been teaching ballet for the past ten years, in her spare time. There were only two obvious things that were similar about Pascale and John--neither one was ever punctual--and both had difficult dispositions, and loved to argue, for hours on end. They had turned the art of bickering into an olympic sport.<br><br>The last of Eric and Diana's guests for New Year's Eve were Robert and Anne Smith. They had met the Morrisons thirty years before when Eric delivered Anne's first baby, and their friendship with the Morrisons was born at the same time. Anne and Robert were both attorneys. She was still practicing, at sixty-one, and Robert had become a superior court judge. At sixty-three, he had the appropriately solemn looks that went with his position. But his sometimes dour demeanor was a mask for a kind and gentle heart. He loved his wife, his children, and his friends. He was tall and good looking, and deeply devoted to Anne, and their three children. Eric had delivered all three, and had become one of Anne's favorite friends.<br><br>Robert and Anne had married in law school, and had been together for thirty-eight years. They were the elder statesmen of the group, seemed the most staid, mostly because of their jobs. But they were warm and lively among friends, and had their own style, as the others did as well. They weren't as colorful or as excitable as Pascale and John, or as youthful and stylish in their looks as Eric and Diana. Robert and Anne looked their age, but were young at heart. The six friends were deeply attached to each other, and always had a good time together. They saw a lot of each other, more so than other friends.<br><br>They had dinner once or twice a month, and had shared their joys and hopes and disappointments over the years, their concerns about their children, and even Pascale's deep grief when she was never able to have children. She had wanted them desperately once she retired from the ballet, but it had never worked out for her, and even the fertility specialists Eric sent her to had been unable to do anything for them. Half a dozen attempts at in vitro, and even donor eggs, had been fruitless. And John had stubbornly refused to even consider adopting. He didn't want "someone else's juvenile delinquent," he wanted his own, or none at all. So at forty-seven and sixty, they were childless, and had only each other to rail at, which they both did often, on a variety of subjects, most of the time much to the amusement of the others, who were accustomed to the heated arguments Pascale and John made no attempt to hide and seemed to enjoy.<br><br>The three couples had chartered a sailboat in the Caribbean together once, and rented a house in Long Island several times. They had gone to Europe together more than once, and always enjoyed their joint travels. Despite their very different styles, they were totally compatible, and the best of friends. They not only tolerated each other's foibles, but understood each other in important ways. They had shared a lot of history with each other over time.<br><br>It was fitting that they spend New Year's Eve together. And for the past two decades, it had been a tradition that all three couples cherished, and counted on every year. They rotated houses from year to year, going to Robert and Anne's for quiet, early evenings some years, which ended just after the stroke of midnight, or to John and Pascale's, for disorganized, hastily thrown together, but delicious dinners, and the champagne and wines John and Pascale argued about and collected. She preferred French wines, and he opted for California. But everyone's favorite locale for New Year's Eve was Eric and Diana's. Their home was comfortable and elegant, the cook Diana used for evenings like these was excellent and capable, and never intruded, the food was good, the wines were great, and in their impeccably decorated apartment, everyone felt they had to look their best and be on their best behavior. Even Pascale and John made an effort to behave when they came there, although they didn't always succeed, and some minor argument would erupt about the name of a wine neither of them could remember, or a trip they wanted to take. John loved Africa, and Pascale the South of France, and often John would make inflammatory comments about Pascale's mother, whom he hated. He pretended to hate France, the French, and everything about them, including and most especially his mother-in-law, and Pascale would cheerfully reciprocate, with acerbic comments about his...</p><h2>Towers in the Mist: The Cathedral Trilogy</h2><p>A charming tale of hope and love, set amid the dreaming spires of Elizabethan Oxford.

Anger and stress are perhaps the two most defining aspects of our world today.&nbsp; There are many ways of handling stress and anger. Dr. Wayne Mack, one of the most well-known and trusted Christian counselors of our time, puts his years of experience and Bible knowledge to work for you in this book!&nbsp; In it, he tells you not just how to handle anger but the root causes of anger.&nbsp; By doing this, Dr. Mack helps you better understand why your reactions to stress and its accompanying anger are usually the result of "not getting what we think we need."</p><p><strong>Dr. Wayne Mack</strong> is a noted teacher, author, counselor, and conference speaker.

At once violent and erotic, brutal and strangely beautiful, it takes us into the heart of the legendary ''first city'' known as Primordium, the site of political upheaval, passionate encounters, and astonishing acts of transformation.<br><br>Lurking at the edges of this extravagant tale is the ancient entity known as ''Agonistes,'' who accepts the pleas of selected ''Supplicants,'' transforming them, through a combination of art, magic, and pain, into avatars of violence and revenge.<br><br>The story begins when a freelance assassin named Zarles Krieger commits a routine murder-for-hire. This act will lead him to two life-altering encounters, one with the daughter of his victim, the other with Agonistes himself. This conjunction of the human and the inhuman stands at the center of this instantly absorbing creation.<br><br>With great authority and equally great economy, ''Tortured Souls'' expands to become a portrait of Primordium itself, with its hierarchies, its hidden mysteries, its shifting power structure, and--most significantly--its indelible cast of characters. A perfectly controlled example of what Barker calls ''the fantastique,'' ''Tortured Souls'' is something truly special, a story whose imaginative reach and sheer narrative power are evident on every page.</p><p></p><h2>The Illusion of Technique: A Search for Meaning in a Technological Civilization</h2><p>Ex library copy may have sticker/stamp and some shelf wear</p><p></p><h2>Orlando (Vintage Classics)</h2><p>Orlando&#x2019;s journey, from the court of Queen Elizabeth I to modern times will also be an internal one. He is an impulsive poet who learns patience in matters of the heart, and a woman who knows what it is to be a man. Virginia&#x2019;s Woolf&#x2019;s most unusual and fantastic creation is a funny, exuberant tale which examines the very nature of sexuality.</p><p>In 1928, way before everyone else was talking about gender-bending and way, way before the terrific movie with Tilda Swinton, Virginia Woolf wrote her comic masterpiece, a fantastic, fanciful love letter disguised as a biography, to Vita Sackville-West. Orlando enters the book as an Elizabethan nobleman and leaves the book three centuries and one change of gender later as a liberated woman of the 1920s. Along the way this most rambunctious of Woolf&#39;s characters engages in sword fights, trades barbs with 18th century wits, has a baby, and drives a car. This is a deliriously written, breathless-making book and a classic both of lesbian literature and the Western canon.Introduction by Quentin Bell <br> <br>Originally conceived by Virginia Woolf as a playful tribute to Vita Sackville-West, the central character lives as both a man and a woman through four centuries.

Back in the US, Hoover embarked on an eventful career as a test pilot, flying experimental aircraft for the US Air Force. Among other memorable moments he recalls with the help of USA Today columnist Shaw, is his experience as Chuck Yeager's backup on the epic 1947 flight during which the X-1 first broke the sound barrier. Although Hoover left the military for private industry in 1949, he was in the thick of aerial combat over Korea, demonstrating the F-86's capabilities as a dive bomber. Since then, Hoover has made a heady living on the global barnstorming circuit, performing spectacular feats of aerobatics and becoming known as King of the Air Shows. The holder of several speed records and recipient of countless honors, he has rubbed shoulders and wingtips with many of aviation's greats: Neil Armstrong, Jacqueline Cochran, Charles Lindbergh, Eddie Rickenbacker, and more. He has appreciably fewer fond memories of the Federal Aviation Administration, which grounded him in 1992. With more than a little help from his many friends, however, the aging pilot won this dogfight last October and is again licensed to solo in this country. An exciting and engrossing memoir from one of aviation's more engaging pioneers. (Author tour) -- <i>Copyright �1996, Kirkus Associates, LP.

He dominated the waves, ruled his peers' imaginations, and&#x2014;to this day&#x2014;inspires the fantasies of decades of Dora wannabes who began to swarm his pristine paradise after the movie <em>Gidget</em> helped surfing explode into the mainstream and changed it forever&#x2014;many say for the worse. </p><p>Disenchanted, Dora railed against the ruination; angry that the waves were no longer his own, he fought back&#x2014;or found better things to do. Dora was also an avid sportsman, raconteur, philosopher, traveler&#x2014;and scam artist of wide repute. When, in 1973, he finally ran afoul of the law, he soon abandoned America and led the FBI and Interpol on a seven-year chase around the globe. At the same time, he never gave up searching for (and occasionally finding) the empty waves and spirit of the Malibu he'd lost. From homes in New Zealand to South Africa to France, he continued to personify the rebel heart of surfing and has been widely acknowledged as "the most relentlessly committed surfer of all time." </p><p>The <em>New York Times</em> named him "the most renegade spirit the sport has yet to produce." <em>Vanity Fair</em> called him "a dark prince of the beach." The <em>Times</em> (London) wrote, "A hero to a generation of beach bums. He was tanned . . . good-looking . . . trouble." </p><p>To capture Dora's never-before-told story, David Rensin spent four years interviewing more than three hundred of Dora's friends, enemies, family members, lovers, and peers&#x2014;none of whom would previously talk in depth about him&#x2014;to uncover the truth about surfing's most outrageous practitioner, charismatic prince, chief antihero, committed loner, and enduring mystery. The result is a riveting and living portrait of an uncommon character whose unique influence on surfing has never waned, and who became what most can never be: a legend in his own time. </p></p><p><p><b>Amazon Best of the Month, April 2008</b>: Defining the life of legendary surf icon Miklos "Miki" Dora can be as elusive as the man himself. The self-proclaimed "King of Malibu" has been compared to trailblazers such as Bob Dylan, Jack Kerouac, and Pablo Picasso for providing the archetype of the counterculture surfer. Yet he was also a convicted felon who rarely missed an opportunity to scam even his closest friends. <i>All for a Few Perfect Waves</i> meets this conflicted figure head on, as David Rensin provides a rare look at the famously guarded Dora through hundreds of interviews with those who knew him best. The result is a portrait of a life wedged between hyperbole and vulnerability. His beguiling personality charmed many, but few relationships and situations were ever deemed off-limits to a con. Happily, any judgments are left up to the reader, as Rensin's engaging narrative seeks only to explore the inner workings of a man who truly lived life on his own terms. <i>--Dave Callanan</i> </p> <strong>An Exclusive Q&amp;A with David Rensin, Author of <i>All for a Few Perfect Waves</i></strong> <br><br> <b>When profiling an elusive figure like Miki Dora, the "why" is evident, but not the "how." How did you manage to gain unfettered access to Dora lore?</b> <br> <i>Rensin:</i> To gain access to people, stories and material like letters, faxes, emails, photos, and interviews, I had to first gain everyone's trust - not an easy task when you consider that Miki spent his life mostly avoiding the press, complaining about it, telling his friends to not sell him about and not talk about him. And, when someone did break through and write about him, as I did for the August 1983 issue of California magazine - for a long time the only mainstream press story about Miki; the rest were in surf genre magazines, including interviews, and Dora's own stories about improbable international adventures - he was likely to threaten a lawsuit. (But never win.) <br><br> I started with Miki's father, who sent me to Harry Hodge, the administrator of Miki's estate. Harry is from Australia, and he was head of Quiksilver in Europe, so we met several times when he came through Los Angeles. It really came down to the human connection. We hit it off. He told me what he thought a biography of Miki would have to entail: not trashing Miki, not whitewashing him, not sensationalizing. And the book still had to be warts and all - otherwise it would be seen as dishonest. I told him I could do that. I wouldn't dance on Miki's grave, but I also had to be totally independent. I would not let anyone control the story. My loyalty would be to the story, whatever I found. <br><br> I also told him that I thought an oral history, with some narrative connective tissue, would work best because I could gather 360 degrees of opinion about and experiences with Miki. I thought that was the only fair way to go with someone who had such a multi-faceted personality, who compartmentalized so well. If I took a side, I'd get strong reaction against it from some quarter. Better to be non-judgmental about a character about whom everyone was very judgmental. <br><br> This helped really put people at ease, and allowed me to get the best and most honest material. No one felt they had to defend a point of view. And though it might run counter to the classic biography, I didn't want to figure out Miki, but to let his mystique remain. <br><br> Harry liked that and passed me back to Miki's father, Miklos Dora, Sr. We talked, I told him the same. I knew I had to be absolutely authentic with him and he was authentic in return. He had read the California magazine piece and thought it had captured Miki's character. He also told me I'd been "a little hard" on his son as well. I gave him some of my other books to read. He liked them and gave me the go-ahead. <br><br> Now came the hard part: finding people who knew Miki and convincing them to trust me to do a non-judgmental book that wouldn't focus on the easy "outlaw" aspects of his life that landed him in jail for a short while, nor treat him only as a faded old celebrity surfer from Malibu. The idea was to do a portrait of the man, and in so doing, explain the myth. Harry had told me that when discussing the book with Miki over twenty years of lunches and dinners, Miki said he wanted to be thought of as more than just a surfer. As a journalist who had spent some years surfing, but not a surf journalist, I felt I could give him that bigger tableau. <br><br> In the end, the tone of my interviews, the questions I asked, the passion I shared, and my willingness to listen instead of try to fit the story to preconceived ideas won out and people trusted me and word spread. I got over one million words of interviews from more than 300 people on five continents. <br><br> I guess it worked. <br><br> <b>How do you think the famously guarded Miki would react to this book?</b> <br> <i>Rensin:</i> I was often asked how Miki would react to the book; would he even want it done? Miki had always emphasized how privacy was important. He supposedly hated the commercialization of surfing and his name. These were strong and authentic themes in his life. But they were not absolute. Did he hate being photographed? I've seen many, many snapshots of him. Did he hate surfboard companies and clothing companies? Not if they didn't try to rip him off. Yes, there was a general discontent and desire to be left alone at times--and he wanted empty waves--but his actions were often situational, not carved in stone. <br><br> I think that publicly Miki would say he didn't want a book, but privately he would want it. He had to be able to put it down, to always have plausible deniability. Part of what I had to do to gain access to interviews was prove that Miki in fact wanted a legacy. I could do that because I had the correspondence as evidence. He had talked with potential book collaborators and had done some interviews. He met with people who wanted to make movies of his life. It never worked out. Some people say he just gamed these suitors for money, and in some cases that is true. But not always. I think Miki never did his book/movie because had to live his life instead of write about it, and because he wanted too much to be in control. I respect that: the wanting to get it just how he wants it. It's his life after all. He didn't want anyone interpreting it. But he had difficulty trusting co-authors. I suppose he was simply waiting for the right person with the right point of view to come along, but as an experienced collaborator, I wonder how well he would have weathered the ups and downs inherent in that kind of working relationship. It's never easy. <br><br> In the end, Miki left the evidence of his life (letters, notebooks, etc.) that he could easily have trashed. He knew someone would inevitably do something. He called it the vultures picking at his bones. <br><br> Anyway, does it matter whether or not Miki would have wanted the book? I don't think so. <br><br> How would he have reacted? He'd have said I blew it, that I could have gotten the real story if only I'd taken the time. But he'd have carried the book everywhere, showed it around and, depending on the situation, would have said he hated it or loved it. That's Miki. <br><br> <b>How was Miki able to reconcile the fact that he played such a significant role in rise of 60's surf cinema? Considering that these films created the surfing population explosion that Miki loathed, it would seem that he made quite a complex bed for himself.</b> <br> <i>Rensin:</i> I don't think Miki played that big a role in the rise of surf cinema. The irony is simply that at a time when he was most loudly decrying the exploitation of surfing because Gidget and other beach party films had crowded his beloved Malibu, he was also taking money to be a stunt rider and technical advisor. Maybe his ego couldn't let him stay away. Maybe it was the free lunch at the craft services table. Maybe it was his notion that he could subvert from the inside by acting weird as an extra in the background. Maybe he met some women he wanted. Maybe it was just fun, there was no surf, and he needed to do something that day. Later in life he realized that he had in some small way aided and abetted, but I don't think he wasted much time with regret. <br><br> <b>Miki has been compared to everyone from Jesus to James Dean. However, after reading <i>All for a Few Perfect Waves</i>, I found my own comparison: he was the Tyler Durden of surfing. Akin to the <i>Fight Club</i> character, surfers cannot always condone Dora's antics, but we quietly support his pursuit for point-break perfection. Do you agree?</b><br> <i>Rensin:</i> I agree. Miki, like Durden, was that sage of harsh reality who made his own way, and the hell with the rest of you. Like Durden he was not completely a loner, and was willing to bring along new initiates if they attracted him with their own inner search. Often while writing the book, I kept thinking about <i>Fight Club</i> and how the rule never to talk about Fight Club was Miki's rule for himself. Many of Durden's aphorisms apply as well to Miki: "The things you own end up owning you." "It's only after we've lost everything that we're free to do anything." And my favorite, "Fight club exists only when fight club begins and when it ends." Or, as Miki famously said: "When there's surf I'm totally committed. When there's none, it doesn't exist." <br><br> <b>How important was Dora's close and inflammatory relationship with Greg Noll?</b> <br> <i>Rensin:</i> Dora's relationship with Greg Noll endured fifty choppy years and I think it was an anchor, a familiar place to return to. Noll just didn't take crap from Dora, yet he appreciated the rascal in him. Noll had it, too. They met as kids. They were of an era and mindset. Noll never wanted anything from Dora. When they made "Da Cat" boards, he endured the games Dora played. And he wasn't afraid - after Dora would pay him a visit at home - to ask to check his suitcase for the silverware. He knew what Dora was about, and he let him know he knew, but he never shunned him for it. They could appreciate each other and that love, if you want to call it that, grew over time. Also, Noll is physically imposing. You don't mess with Noll. Dora didn't. <br><br> <b>What is your favorite Dora story or experience?</b> <br> <i>Rensin:</i> It's really tough to come up with a favorite Dora story or experience. Overall, I love his audacity, his willingness to go against the grain, to not be bound by the rules, to so cannily manipulate an innocent surf media to his advantage after they'd helped rip away his paradise of empty waves. He was always pulling stunts like wearing a see-though plastic mask, or letting his groupies chauffeur him around, or having what he called his "party kit" (everything from a glass with ice cubes to a tuxedo, so he could crash Beverly Hills doings with ease), to various little cons and pranks (baby chicks in the lifeguard tower). There are too many to go into here. But I guess if I had to chose, a favorite would be Miki being baptized in the Mormon church when he lived in New Zealand in 1975. He played on the eagerness of two young missionaries and led them on a merry chase. I'm sure he was authentically curious about their vision of the universe, but I think he was definitely tongue-in-cheek. And best of all, he went through with the immersion. Dora was living theater. The idea, the best approach now and then, was to sit back and enjoy the show.Advance Praise for <i>ALL FOR A FEW PERFECT WAVES</i> <p> "You can't beat the shape of real life.

In <i>The Fabric of Reality</i>, Deutsch traces what he considers the four main strands of scientific explanation: quantum theory, evolution, computation, and the theory of knowledge. "The four of them taken together form a coherent explanatory structure that is so far-reaching, and has come to encompass so much of our understanding of the world, that in my view it may already properly be called the first Theory of Everything." Deutsch covers some difficult material with unusual clarity.

The first two titles, Elements and Molecules, have sold more than 1.5 million copies worldwide. With Reactions bestselling author Theodore Gray continues the journey through our molecular and chemical world that began with the tour de force The Elements and continued with Molecules. In The Elements, Gray gave us a never-before-seen, mesmerizing photographic view of the 118 elements in the periodic table. In Molecules, with the same phenomenal photographic acumen, plus beautifully rendered computer generated graphics, he showed us how the elements combine to form the content that makes up our universe, from table salt to oxygen to the panoply of colors and smells that surround us. At last, we&#39;ve reached Reactions, in which Gray once again puts his photography and storytelling to work demonstrating how molecules interact in ways that are essential to our very existence. The book begins with a brief recap of elements and molecules and then goes on to explain important concepts the characterize a chemical reaction, including Energy, Entropy, and Time. It is then organized by type of reaction including chapters such as &#34;Fantastic Reactions and Where to Find Them,&#34; &#34;On the Origin of Light and Color,&#34; &#34;The Boring Chapter,&#34; in which we learn about reactions such as paint drying, grass growing, and water boiling, and &#34;The Need for Speed,&#34; including topics such as weather, ignition, and fire.</p><p></p><h2>House of Bondage: A South African Black Man Exposes in His Own Pictures and Words the Bitter Life of His Homeland Today</h2><p>From the publisher: &#34;The House of Bondage is the dwelling-place of the black people of South Africa, whose bitter life is one of the tragedies of our century.

But this hope was soon destroyed. As recorded by contemporary chroniclers, the reigns of the next four Plantagenet monarchs were marked by a series of continuing horrors, of famine and war, disorder and cruelty, culminating with the Black Death - the plague that swept across Europe and killed almost half its population. This book and its chronicles focus on the lives of the four monarchs who reigned from 1216 to 1377: Henry III, pious and shrewd but also cunning and suspicious, who ruled for 56 years; Edward I, a great administrator and military leader, who tamed the Welsh and hammered the Scots; the dissolute Edward II, who was murdered at Berkeley Castle; and Edward III, who with his son the Black Prince led England into the long and destructive Hundred Years War. With the death of Edward III, this turbulent period came to a close. However, the Plantagenet world would prove to have been at the center of great and lasting changes in political power and in social and economic structures. For the first time in history, parliament included commoners as well as the great nobles, and during this time, English emerged as the lingua franca of the nation. Between 1216 and 1377, the Plantagenet dynasty from Anjou became an English family of kings. Along with the original chronicles, 100 explanatory essays and more than 200 illustrations highlight the background of contemporary events, people, customs and traditions. They include information and commentary on women and sex, herbal remedies, music and food, and contain assessments of the personalities of great kings, queens and men of power, as well as the daily lives of ordinary people - bringing to life one of history&#39;s most exciting periods.</p><p></p><h2>Futures Imperfect (Three Short Novels)</h2><p>Used.

In Thalia, Texas, Larry McMurtry epitomizes small-town America and through characters reintroduced in <i>Texasville</i> and <i>Duane&#x2019;s Depressed</i>, captures the ecstasy and heartbreak of adolescence.<br><br><i>The Last Picture Show</i> is one of Larry McMurtry's most memorable novels, and the basis for the enormously popular movie of the same name. Set in a small, dusty, Texas town, <i>The Last Picture Show</i> introduced the characters of Jacy, Duane, and Sonny: teenagers stumbling toward adulthood, discovering the beguiling mysteries of sex and the even more baffling mysteries of love. Populated by a wonderful cast of eccentrics and animated by McMurtry's wry and raucous humor, <i>The Last Picture Show</i> is a wild, heartbreaking, and poignant novel that resonates with the magical passion of youth.</p><p>In <i>The Last Picture Show</i> Larry McMurtry introduced characters who would show up again in later novels, <i>Texasville</i> and <i>Duane's Depressed</i>. This first volume of the trilogy drops the reader into the one-stoplight town of Thalia, Texas, where Duane Moore, his buddy Sonny, and his girlfriend Jacy are all stumbling along the rocky road to adulthood. Duane wants nothing more than to marry Jacy; Sonny wants what Duane has; and Jacy wants to get the hell out of Thalia any way she can. This is not a novel of big ideas or defining moments; over the course of a year Duane and Jacy make up and break up, Sonny begins an affair with his high-school football coach's wife, and the only movie house in town closes its doors forever. Yet it is out of these small-town experiences--a nude swimming party in Wichita, a failed sexual encounter during a senior trip, a botched elopement, an enlistment--that McMurtry builds his tale and reveals his characters' hearts. No epiphanies here, just a lot of hard-won experience that leaves none of his protagonists particularly wiser, though they're all a little sadder by the end. <i>--Alix Wilber</i>6 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>Finch</h2><p>In <i>Finch,</i> mysterious underground inhabitants known as the gray caps have reconquered the failed fantasy state Ambergris and put it under martial law. They have disbanded House Hoegbotton and are controlling the human inhabitants with strange addictive drugs, internment in camps, and random acts of terror. The rebel resistance is scattered, and the gray caps are using human labor to build two strange towers. Against this backdrop, John Finch, who lives alone with a cat and a lizard, must solve an impossible double murder for his gray cap masters while trying to make contact with the rebels. Nothing is as it seems as Finch and his disintegrating partner Wyte negotiate their way through a landscape of spies, rebels, and deception. Trapped by his job and the city, Finch is about to come face to face with a series of mysteries that will change him and Ambergris forever.</p><p>Jeffrey Scott VanderMeer is an American writer, editor and publisher. He is best known for his contributions to the New Weird and his stories about the city of Ambergris, in books like City of Saints and Madmen.From The Washington Post's Book World/washingtonpost.com Reviewed by by Victor LaValle John Finch has been called to a crime scene at 239 Manzikert Ave., Apartment 525. He stands outside the front door, his chest heaving after climbing five flights of stairs. Checks his gun in its holster. The doorknob of Apartment 525 is covered in a light green fungus, but Finch doesn't shudder; he turns it anyway and steps inside, repeating five words to himself: "I am not a detective. I am not a detective." And just that quickly, Jeff VanderMeer's intriguing and highly original novel "Finch" begins. Finch is a detective working in an occupied city decimated by war. The city is Ambergris, a mythical border town occupied by Gray Caps. They're some sort of fungal life, with heads like giant mushrooms -- thus their nickname. These creatures once lived far underground, but they rose to the surface and defeated the human armies. Then the Gray Caps instituted the law of most occupiers: Follow orders or die. Working as a cop in occupied territory, Finch discovers a spectacularly strange double murder in Apartment 525: two bodies -- one human and one Gray Cap. But here's the trick: Both died falling from a great height. Were their bodies dumped? Or could there be another, more complicated explanation? Finch catches the case but doesn't want it. In Ambergris, answers are as dangerous as bullets. "Finch," as should be clear, plays with the conventions of detective novels. Grizzled sleuth? Check. Mysterious woman who brings trouble? At least two. And a plot with more twists than the health-care debate. Despite these trappings, though, "Finch" wriggles from the grip of easy categorization. It's full of fantastical elements and genuinely humane ones, too. VanderMeer can write beautifully, summarizing the deprivations of life in war-torn Ambergris, for instance, with haunting subtlety: "239 Manzikert Avenue was a dark vertical slab of stone and wood with blackened filigree balcony railings crawling up the front. Trees left black leaves and rotting yellow berries on the steps. If the berries had been edible, the steps would've been clean." To a large degree, "Finch" is about life under occupation. VanderMeer writes insightfully about those caught in the middle of war. He makes one think of Baghdad in 2005 or Kabul today. There are rebels, a phantom insurgency more rumor than reality, and there are Gray Caps, but Finch and most other residents of Ambergris shuffle somewhere in between. Early in the novel, Finch recalls something written on the wall of another crime scene: "Everyone's a collaborator. Everyone's a rebel." And this introduces the true concern of the novel: How do you choose sides when both are willing to kill you? In Finch's case, he works as an officer for the Gray Caps. He collaborates with the occupiers. But his past -- and future -- harbors rebellion. Nearly every character teeters along this edge. All the residents jump to whichever side will keep them alive; loyalties may change tomorrow. To complicate matters, there are even old rivalries among the humans: Age-old clan ties that carry the whiff of Sunni vs. Shia, Catholic vs. Protestant. It's a testament to VanderMeer's talent that he suggests such comparisons but never lets them overwhelm the tale. By the end, Finch has chased clues across the city and even across dimensions. His actions are central to the climax, but ultimately he's more witness than participant. The fortunes of Ambergris seem likely to change, but who will really benefit? Civilians caught between warring factions find "victory" a dubious concept. The important questions remain the same: What must I do to survive tomorrow? What will another day of life cost me? The story's final moments may seem triumphant, but this complex novel rejects simple conclusions. bookworld@washpost.com <br>Copyright 2009, The Washington Post.

Along with hundreds of other Chinese, the brothers are going to help build a great railroad across the West. But as days grow into months, Shek and Wong endure more than they could have imagined--bleeding hands, blasting dynamite, and treacherous avalanches. For very little pay. Are they being treated this way because of their almond-shaped eyes--because they are coolies? <p>Inspired by actual events in the history of the American railroad, <b>Cooliesa</b> reveals the harsh truth about life for thousands of Chinese laborers, while it celebrates the love and loyalty between two brothers who were determined not only to survive, but to succeed.</p></p><p>INSIGHTS FROM AUTHOR, YIN: I am first generation Chinese American and was born in Brooklyn, New York. I grew up on the 19th floor on the lower east side of Manhattan. I did not learn about the Chinese contribution to American history when I was educated in New York City. This is due to a lack of books on the subject. I felt a need for the next generation to "connect" with a sense of pride of our forefather's sacrifices. It seems fitting to me to write about how my ancestors have worked on the railroads many years ago-and that was how COOLIES was conceived. <p>My grandmother was my key resource while I conducting the research for this story. The Chinese railroad workers were mainly from my village in Canton, China. This is why the early Chinese Americans can speak Cantonese, Chinese. For the most part, my family's history was a blur to my dear aging grandmother. Since this is a historical story, I had to compare her data and spend allot of time at the library researching. I had to fine tune the story and make sure the events and facts were truthful. Did you know they rode on a clipper ship not a steam ship? But this is only one example of the challenges to ensure that even their mode of transport was depicted accurately. The Golden Spike Museum in Utah was very kind to share some pictures and old original documents. </p><p>This story was constructed over two years with the guidance of my editor, Patricia Lee Gauch at Philomel/Penguin Books. In time, history can be forgotten. It is my hopes COOLIES will sustain that test of time because stories like this must be told again and again.

A fine powder of reddish sand, blown southward from the vast Arabian Desert, coated the labyrinth of narrow alleyways that snake throughout the city. On crowded sidewalks, beneath high walls topped with shards of broken glass, women in black chadors paraded with men in drab suit coats and red-and-white checkered scarves that hung loose like long shawls. It is a city of -well--oiled Kalashnikovs and jewel-encrusted daggers known as jambiyahs; a place where former comrades from the once Marxist south sit on battered sidewalk chairs chewing qat and puffing from hookahs with wrinkled imams from the tribal north.<br><br>At the northwest edge of the city in Madbah, a cluttered neighborhood of cinder-block homes and yapping dogs, was a boxy, sand-swept house. Across the street sat a vacant lot littered with stones, bits of concrete, and tufts of greenish weeds. Made of cement and surrounded by a black iron fence, the house had a solid, fortresslike appearance. On the flat roof were three chimneys, one for each floor, and open balconies that were wide and square, like bull pens at a rodeo; glass arches topped the windows and doors.<br><br>It was the home of Ahmed -al-Hada, a middle-aged Yemeni who had become friends with Osama bin Laden while fighting alongside him against the Russians in Afghanistan. Hada came from a violent family tribe based for generations in Dhamar Province, about sixty miles south of Sanaa. In a valley of squat, mud-brick houses and green terraced farms, the region was sandwiched between two volcanic peaks in the Yemen Highlands. The area had achieved some fame as a center for the breeding of thoroughbred horses. It also gained fame for kidnappings.<br><br>A devoted follower of bin Laden, Hada offered to turn his house into a secret operations center for his friend in Afghanistan. While the rugged Afghan landscape provided bin Laden with security, it was too isolated and remote to manage the day-to-day logistics for his growing worldwide terrorist organization. His sole tool of communication was a gray, battery-powered $7,500 Compact-M satellite phone. About the size of a laptop computer, it could transmit and receive both voice phone calls and fax messages from virtually anywhere in the world over the Inmarsat satellite network. His phone number was 00-873-682505331; the 00 meant it was a satellite call, 873 indicated the phone was in the Indian Ocean area, and 682505331 was his personal number.<br><br>Bin Laden needed to set up a separate operations center somewhere outside Afghanistan, somewhere with access to regular telephone service and close to major air links. He took Hada up on his offer, and the house in Yemen quickly became the epicenter of bin Laden's war against America, a logistics base to coordinate his attacks, a switchboard to pass on orders, and a safe house where his field commanders could meet to discuss and carry out operations. Between 1996 and 1998, bin Laden and his top aides made a total of 221 calls to the ops center's phone number, 011-967-1-200-578, using the house to coordinate the 1998 bombings of the U.S. embassies in East Africa and to plan the attack of the USS Cole in the port of Aden in 2000.<br><br>Also living in the house was Hada's daughter, Hoda, along with her husband, Khalid al-Mihdhar. Standing 5'6" and weighing 142 pounds, Mihdhar had an intelligent face, with a soft, unblemished complexion and a neatly trimmed mustache. Wearing glasses, he had the appearance of a young university instructor. But it was war, not tenure, that interested Mihdhar. He had been training in secret for months to lead a massive airborne terrorist attack against the U.S. Now he was just waiting for the phone call to begin the operation.<br><br>Khalid al-Mihdhar began life atop Yemen's searing sandscape on May 16, 1975. Shortly thereafter, he and his family moved to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. It was the beginning of the oil boom and the Mihdhars, like thousands of others in the poverty-racked country, hoped to take advantage of the rivers of petrodollars then flowing into the Kingdom. They settled in the holy city of Mecca, Khalid's father was successful, and the family became Saudi citizens.<br><br>For centuries the Mihdhar tribe was prominent in the remote Yemen provinces that merge invisibly into Saudi Arabia across an endless expanse of drifting sand dunes. Known as the Empty Quarter, the provinces are a geographical twilight zone, a void on the map where governments, borders, and lines of demarcation have scarcely intruded. Horizon to horizon, there are only the occasional Bedouins who pass like a convoy of ships on a sea of sand. In the city of Tarim is the al-Mihdhar mosque, with its strikingly beautiful minaret reaching more than seventeen stories into the sky, the tallest such structure in southern Arabia. It was built in honor of the -fifteenth--century religious leader Omar-al-Mihdhar, the grand patriarch of the tribe.<br><br>When Mihdhar was growing up, one of his neighborhood friends was Nawaf al-Hazmi, whose father owned a supermarket and a building in the Nawariya district in northwest Mecca and whose older brother was a police chief in Jizan, a city in southwest Saudi Arabia across the border from Yemen. Darker, more muscular, and a year younger than Khalid, he came from a prominent and financially well-off family of nine sons. His father, Muhammad Salem al-Hazmi, described both Nawaf and his younger brother, Salem, as "well-behaved, nice young men who have been brought up in a family atmosphere free from any social or psychological problems." Nevertheless, Nawaf would later complain that his father once cut him with a knife that left a long scar on his forearm.<br><br>Soon after turning eighteen, Hazmi packed a duffel bag and left for Afghanistan to learn the art of warfare. But by 1993 the war against the Soviet occupiers was long over and Osama bin Laden had returned to his contracting business in Sudan. Undeterred, Hazmi called his family from Peshawar, Pakistan, near the Afghan border, and told them he was going to fight in Chechnya. Very concerned, Muhammad al-Hazmi went to Peshawar to bring his son home. "I went to Peshawar," he recalled. "I found him there. He said he was staying in Pakistan as a trader of frankincense and we returned home together. I asked him to help me in my commercial ventures, including shops and hotels." Speaking of his sons, he added, "In fact, I planned to open branches for them and to find brides for them. But they did not stay for long."<br><br>Returning to Mecca with his father, Hazmi met with a key al-Qaeda member and in 1996, bubbling with enthusiasm, convinced Mihdhar to join him in a new war, this one in Bosnia defending fellow Muslims from attacks by the Serbs.<br><br>What drove Mihdhar, Hazmi, and thousands of others was a burning need to defend Muslim lands from the West, which had a long history, as they saw it, of invading and occupying their territory, killing and humiliating their families, and supporting their corrupt rulers. The victory in Afghanistan over the Soviets, a superpower, was their first real win and gave many Muslims across the region a sense of unity, fueling an ideology that viewed their separate countries as a single Muslim nation--what they called the "ulema." An occupation or invasion of one Muslim state was therefore an aggression against all Muslim states.<br><br>Now with the taste of victory over Russia still sweet in their mouths, adrenaline still pumping through their veins, and a new sense of Muslim nationalism, many were no longer willing to sit and wait for the next encroachment on their lands. The West had long waged war on Islam, they believed; now it was Islam's time to defend itself and fight back. The time had come to go on the offensive.<br><br>On August 23, 1996, Osama bin Laden issued his call to action: "My Muslim Brothers of the World," he said. "Your brothers in Palestine and in the land of the two Holy Places [Saudi Arabia] are calling upon your help and asking you to take part in fighting against the enemy--your enemy and their enemy--the Americans and the Israelis. They are asking you to do whatever you can, with your own means and ability, to expel the enemy, humiliated and defeated, out of the sanctities of Islam."<br><br>Turning his attention to the United States, he said, "[We] hold you responsible for all of the killings and evictions of the Muslims and the violation of the sanctities, carried out by your Zionist brothers [Israel] in Lebanon; you openly supplied them with arms and finance [during Israel's bloody Grapes of Wrath invasion]. More than 600,000 Iraqi children have died due to lack of food and medicine and as a result of the unjustifiable aggression [the sanctions] imposed on Iraq and its nation. The children of Iraq are our children. You, the U.S.A., together with the Saudi regime, are responsible for the shedding of the blood of these innocent children."<br><br>The charges resonated with Mihdhar and Hazmi, and in about 1997 Hazmi returned to Afghanistan, formally swore his loyalty to bin Laden, and fought against the Northern Alliance, possibly with his brother, Salem. Mihdhar followed, and swore his allegiance to the al-Qaeda leader in 1998. They would become the elite of al-Qaeda, among the first seventeen to join from the Arabian Peninsula. Bin Laden would call them "The Founders." Early on, the al-Qaeda leader had developed a special affection and trust--almost father-son at times--for Mihdhar. They shared a common heritage, both sets of ancestors having come from the remote, desolate Yemeni province of Hadramont.<br><br>In the spring of 1999, bin Laden and his operations chief, Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, worked out a plan to bring their war to the doorstep of the enemy. Using large commercial airliners, they would in one swoop bring mass destruction to America's financial, political, and military centers: the World Trade Center, the White House, and the Pentagon. During the meeting, bin Laden ...</p><h2>Modern Classics To the Lighthouse (Penguin Modern Classics)</h2><p>A pioneering work of modernist fiction, using her unique stream-of-consciousness technique to explore the inner lives of her characters, Virginia Woolf&#39;s To the Lighthouse is widely regarded as one of the greatest artistic achievements of the twentieth century. This Penguin Classics edition is edited by Stella McNichol, with an introduction and notes by Hermione Lee. To the Lighthouse is at once a vivid impressionistic depiction of a family holiday, and a meditation on marriage, on parenthood and childhood, on grief, tyranny and bitterness. For years now the Ramsays have spent every summer in their holiday home in Scotland, and they expect these summers will go on forever; but as the First World War looms, the integrity of family and society will be fatally challenged. With a psychologically introspective mode, the use of memory, reminiscence and shifting perspectives gives the novel an intimate, poetic essence, and at the time of publication in 1927 it represented an utter rejection of Victorian and Edwardian literary values. Virginia Woolf (1882-1941) is regarded as a major 20th century author and essayist, a key figure in literary history as a feminist and modernist, and the centre of &#39;The Bloomsbury Group&#39;, an informal collective of artists and writers that exerted a powerful influence over early twentieth-century British culture. Between 1925 and 1931 Virginia Woolf produced what are now regarded as her finest masterpieces, from Mrs Dalloway (1925) to the poetic and highly experimental novel The Waves (1931).

Warrior monks in their armed citadels block the road to the capital; castles are destroyed, villages plundered, fields put to the torch.<br><br>Amid this devastation, three men dream of uniting the nation. At one extreme is the charismatic but brutal Nobunaga, whose ruthless ambition crushes all before him. At the opposite pole is the cold, deliberate Ieyasu, wise in counsel, brave in battle, mature beyond his years. But the keystone of this triumvirate is the most memorable of all, Hideyoshi, who rises from the menial post of sandal bearer to become Taiko-absolute ruler of Japan in the Emperor's name. <br><br>When Nobunaga emerges from obscurity by destroying an army ten times the size of his own, he allies himself with Ieyasu, whose province is weak, but whose canniness and loyalty make him invaluable. Yet it is the scrawny, monkey-faced Hideyoshi-brash, impulsive, and utterly fearless-who becomes the unlikely savior of this ravaged land. Born the son of a farmer, he takes on the world with nothing but his bare hands and his wits, turning doubters into loyal servants, rivals into faithful friends, and enemies into allies. In all this he uses a piercing insight into human nature that unlocks castle gates, opens men's minds, and captures women's hearts. For Hideyoshi's passions are not limited to war and intrigue-his faithful wife, Nene, holds his love dear, even when she must share it; the chaste Oyu, sister of Hideyoshi's chief strategist, falls prey to his desires; and the seductive Chacha, whom he rescues from the fiery destruction of her father's castle, tempts his weakness. <br><br>As recounted by Eiji Yoshikawa, author of the international best-seller <em>Musashi</em>, <em>Taiko</em> tells many stories: of the fury of Nobunaga and the fatal arrogance of the black-toothed Yoshimoto; of the pathetic downfall of the House of Takeda; how the scorned Mitsuhide betrayed his master; how once impregnable ramparts fell as their defenders died gloriously. Most of all, though, <em>Taiko</em> is the story of how one man transformed a nation through the force of his will and the depth of his humanity. Filled with scenes of pageantry and violence, acts of treachery and self-sacrifice, tenderness and savagery, <em>Taiko</em> combines the panoramic spectacle of a Kurosawa epic with a vivid evocation of feudal Japan.</p><p><br>EIJI YOSHIKAWA was born in 1892 near Tokyo. Beginning his literary career at the age of twenty-two, he continued to work as a journalist while writing novels that reached a large and appreciative readership. At the time of his death in 1962, he was one of Japan's most popular novelists. His memoirs have been translated as <em>Fragments of a Past</em>. <br><br>WILLIAM SCOTT WILSON, the translator, was born in 1944 and grew up in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. As an undergraduate student at Dartmouth College in 1966, he was invited by a friend to join a three-month kayak trip up the coast of Japan from Shimonoseki to Tokyo. This eye-opening journey, beautifully documented in <em>National Geographic</em>, spurred Wilson's fascination with the culture and history of Japan. <br><br>After receiving a B.A. degree in political science from Dartmouth, Wilson earned a second B.A. in Japanese language and literature from the Monterey Institute of Foreign Studies in Monterey, California, then undertook extensive research on Edo-period (1603-1868) philosophy at the Aichi Prefectural University, in Nagoya, Japan. <br><br>Wilson completed his first translation, <em>Hagakure</em>, while living in an old farmhouse deep in the Japanese countryside. <em>Hagakure</em> saw publication in 1979, the same year Wilson completed an M.A. in Japanese language and literature at the University of Washington. Wilson's other translations include <em>The</em> <em>Book of Five Rings</em>, <em>The Life-Giving Sword</em>, <em>The Unfettered Mind</em>, the Eiji Yoshikawa novel <em>Taiko</em>, and Ideals of the Samurai, which has been used as a college textbook on Japanese history and thought. Two decades after its initial publication, <em>Hagakure</em> was prominently featured in the Jim Jarmusch film <em>Ghost Dog</em>.<br>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Japanese</p><h2>The Plague Dogs</h2><p>"Thousands and thousands of people will love this book!"<br>THE BOSTON GLOBE<br>A lyrical, engrossing tale, by the author of WATERSHIP DOWN, Richard Adams creates a lyrical and engrossing tale, a remarkable journey into the hearts and minds of two canine heroes, Snitter and Rowf, fugitives from the horrors of an animal research center who escape into the isolation--and terror--of the wilderness.<br><i>From the Paperback edition.</i></p><p>11 1.5-hour cassettes"Thousands and thousands of people will love this book!"<br>THE BOSTON GLOBE<br>A lyrical, engrossing tale, by the author of WATERSHIP DOWN, Richard Adams creates a lyrical and engrossing tale, a remarkable journey into the hearts and minds of two canine heroes, Snitter and Rowf, fugitives from the horrors of an animal research center who escape into the isolation--and terror--of the wilderness.</p><h2>The Battle of Tull (3) (Stephen King&#39;s The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger)</h2><p><b>Enter once more the world of Roland Deschain&#x2014;and the world of the Dark Tower...presented in a stunning graphic novel form that will unlock the doorways to terrifying secrets and bold storytelling as part of the dark fantasy masterwork and magnum opus from #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Stephen King.</b><br><br>&#x201c;The man in black fled across the desert, and the gunslinger followed.&#x201d; With these unforgettable words, millions of readers were introduced to Stephen King&#x2019;s iconic character Roland Deschain of Gilead.

That unhappy prospect dampens his spirits somewhat, but Barry has little time to dwell on his romantic disappointments. Christmas may be drawing nigh, but there is little peace to be found on earth, especially for a young doctor plying his trade in the emerald hills and glens of rural Ireland.</p><p>Along with his senior partner, Doctor Fingal Flahertie O'Reilly, Barry has his hands full dealing with seasonal coughs and colds, as well as the occasional medical emergency. To add to the doctors' worries, competition arrives in the form of a patient-poaching new physician whose quackery threatens the health and well-being of the good people of Ballybucklebo. Can one territory support three hungry doctors? Barry has his doubts.</p><p>But the wintry days and nights are not without a few tidings of comfort and joy. Between their hectic medical practice, Rugby Club parties, and the kiddies' Christmas Pageant, the two doctors still find time to play Santa Claus to a struggling single mother with a sick child and not enough money in the bank.

He hunched his shoulders against the sleet and hurried across the car park of the Old Inn in Crawfordsburn, County Down. Night comes early in December in Northern Ireland, and at four-thirty in the afternoon it was barely light enough for him to make out the leafless branches of trees tossing and swaying in the gale, but he could hear the wind battering its way through the glen behind the hotel.<br>He pushed through the inn&#x2019;s double front door and went down three steps into a well-lit lobby. Blinking at the brightness, he twitched his shoulders up and his neck down as a trickle of water found its way under his collar.<br>&#x201c;Hello, John,&#x201d; he said to the manager, who stood behind a reception desk at the far side of the lobby.<br>The middle-aged man looked up and smiled. &#x201c;Good afternoon, Doctor.&#x201d;<br>A little more than a year ago he would have said, &#x201c;How&#x2019;s about ye, Barry?&#x201d; The Old Inn was only a few miles away from Barry&#x2019;s parents&#x2019; home in Bangor. During his years as a medical student, he&#x2019;d often popped in here for a quick pint, and John had been standing in reception for as long as Barry could remember.<br>&#x201c;Dirty day out there,&#x201d; John observed.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m half foundered.&#x201d; Barry rubbed his hands together.<br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s a nice cosy fire lit in the Parlour Bar, sir.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to the reception.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;The Donnelly-MacAteer party&#x2019;s in the Guests Lounge, but Doctor O&#x2019;Reilly&#x2019;s just gone into the Parlour Bar. He said to tell you if you came in.&#x201d;<br>Typical, Barry thought, of Fingal Flahertie O&#x2019;Reilly, the senior man in the practice where Barry worked, to be slipping out to the bar for a quick drink. He knew Julie MacAteer&#x2019;s parents were Pioneers&#x2014;teetotalers&#x2014;so the party would be what was called in Ulster an orange juice reception.<br>&#x201c;Thanks.&#x201d; Barry shrugged out of his raincoat. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll just park this and then nip in and get warm.&#x201d;<br>He caught a glimpse of himself in a mirror mounted at the back of the coat stand. Blue eyes with dark rings beneath looked back from an oval face. At twenty-four he was too young for the dusky half circles to be a permanent feature, but he&#x2019;d attended a confinement for most of the night. Although he might be tired, he thought the woman he&#x2019;d just delivered of a healthy seven-pound five-ounce boy would be a lot more so. He yawned. His fair hair was darkened, soaked, and plastered to his scalp. At least his cow&#x2019;s lick wasn&#x2019;t sticking up like the crest on a tufted duck.<br>Barry hung his coat, ran his hands over his hair, turned, and walked along a short, carpeted corridor to the bar. He wondered if Colette the barmaid, a big, motherly woman, would be on duty tonight.<br>This part of the building, he knew, had been an old coaching inn built in 1614, and generations of owners had very sensibly preserved the whitewashed daub-and-wattle walls and the heavy, rough-hewn, black ceiling beams. C. S. Lewis had stayed here in 1958 with his wife, Joy, for what he called &#x201c;a perfect fortnight.&#x201d;<br>Barry went through a door to his left into a low-ceilinged room where a turf fire blazed in a wide grate. After the bitter cold of the day outside, the heat was stifling, but the scent of the burning peat was familiar and comforting to him. There were several men in the room, most standing at the bar, a few in booths beside the wall. Barry heard a murmuring of conversation. The smells of damp tweed and cigarette smoke mingled with the aroma of peat. He could hear the sleet outside rattling off the curtained windows.<br>&#x201c;You,&#x201d; roared Doctor Fingal Flahertie O&#x2019;Reilly, who stood leaning against the bar, &#x201c;look like a drowned rat. Come on in and have a jar.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Thanks, Fingal.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;ll you have?&#x201d;<br>Barry rapidly rubbed his hands together, feeling them tingle as the circulation returned. &#x201c;Hot Irish, please.&#x201d;<br>O&#x2019;Reilly turned to the barmaid, who stood behind the marble-topped bar polishing a straight pint glass with a dish towel. &#x201c;Do you hear that, Colette?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Hot half-un it is, Doctor.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Half-un be damned. Give him a double.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;How are you, Colette?&#x201d; Barry asked, turning his back on O&#x2019;Reilly, shaking his head at her, and mouthing silently, &#x201c;Just a half.&#x201d; A double whiskey on top of his tiredness could be the end of him.<br>Her smile was wide and welcoming as she nodded her understanding of his order and said, &#x201c;Grand, so I am. Haven&#x2019;t seen you in for a wee while.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been busy&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Jesus, lass, would you give the young fellah his jar?&#x201d; O&#x2019;Reilly said.<br>&#x201c;Coming up.&#x201d; She moved away and switched on an electric kettle.<br>&#x201c;Now, Doctor Laverty,&#x201d; growled O&#x2019;Reilly, &#x201c;where the hell have you been?&#x201d;<br>Barry looked at the big man&#x2019;s florid, craggy face, bushy eyebrows, and his bent nose with a distinct list to port. O&#x2019;Reilly was in his shirtsleeves, red braces holding up his tweed pants. A glass&#x2014;a large glass&#x2014;of what Barry knew would be Irish whiskey was clutched in one hand.<br>&#x201c;Working.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Working? When I left the house for the wedding, the door to the surgery was still shut, but there were only a couple of customers in the waiting room. Nuala Harkness never takes long.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Maybe not for you, Fingal. You&#x2019;ve known the woman for nearly twenty years.&#x201d;<br>O&#x2019;Reilly grunted. &#x201c;And Harry &#x2018;The Boots&#x2019; Hawthorne.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Who?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Harry &#x2018;The Boots&#x2019; Hawthorne. They call him that because when he was first married his wife told her best friend he was so virile that when he came in from the fields and feeling his oats, wanting her, he wouldn&#x2019;t even take the time to get his boots off.&#x201d;<br>Barry laughed. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve read Napoleon was like that with Josephine.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Maybe Harry&#x2019;d read it too. Anyway the wife&#x2019;s friend told her husband, and he told . . . &#x201d;<br>Barry nodded. He had already experienced just how quickly news could fly around the village of Ballybucklebo.<br>&#x201c;So now the lads won&#x2019;t let him live it down, and they call him Harry the Boots. He usually comes in for a tonic, and you can finish with him in five minutes.&#x201d;<br>Barry shook his head. &#x201c;You can Fingal, but I&#x2019;ve only been here for a few months, and if I want to know the patients as well as you I have to spend a bit of time getting to know them.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I suppose so,&#x201d; O&#x2019;Reilly frowned. &#x201c;But two more shouldn&#x2019;t have taken you until now. We expected to see you at the service.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Harry took longer than I expected; then Jeannie Jingles phoned. She thought her wee Eddie had croup and&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;And you went to see the lad?&#x201d; There was a hint of paleness in the tip of O&#x2019;Reilly&#x2019;s nose, a sure sign that his temper was not entirely under control.<br>&#x201c;I know you&#x2019;re meant to be on call today for emergencies, Fingal, but&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You thought you&#x2019;d do me a favour?&#x201d; The pallor spread.<br>&#x201c;Not a favour. You were already in the church. It made sense to me to call in and see the kiddie. I thought it would only take a minute.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Huh. Some minute. The service was over at two thirty. You should have been there.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry.&#x201d; Barry held one hand at shoulder height, palm out. &#x201c;If I&#x2019;d known I was depriving you of the pure delights, the immensely satisfying medical moments of seeing one more case of common croup, I&#x2019;d have sent a police escort to haul you out of your pew.&#x201d;<br>O&#x2019;Reilly managed a chuckle. &#x201c;Alright. Have it your own way. Work yourself into an early grave if that&#x2019;s what you want. See if I give a tinker&#x2019;s damn.&#x201d; The laugh lines deepened at the corners of his eyes.<br>&#x201c;Jesus, Fingal, I just thought it made sense.&#x201d;<br>O&#x2019;Reilly clapped Barry on the shoulder. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re right this once, Barry, but . . . but . . . an agreement&#x2019;s an agreement.&#x201d; O&#x2019;Reilly swallowed a mouthful of whiskey. &#x201c;We decided in August, when you were ready to work on your own, we&#x2019;d split the work.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;And haven&#x2019;t we? One of us in the surgery to see the minor cases, the other one out doing home visits and taking call at night. I thought it was working fine.&#x201d;<br>O&#x2019;Reilly grunted. &#x201c;You were up half the bloody night. I&#x2019;m on call today.&#x201d;One thing Barry had learnt. He must never cave in to O&#x2019;Reilly. He looked the older man right in the eye. &#x201c;It was a bloody good thing I went. The little lad had a raging pneumonia. I had to get him up to the Royal Victoria Hospital immediately.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Had he, by God?&#x201d; O&#x2019;Reilly&#x2019;s eyebrows met above his nose as he frowned. &#x201c;Lobar was it?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;As best as I could tell without an X-ray.&#x201d;<br>O&#x2019;Reilly took a deep swallow of his whiskey, clapped Barry on the shoulder, and said, &#x201c;Maybe you did do the right thing.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I think so.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;So do I.&#x201d; O&#x2019;Reilly nodded. &#x201c;But as of this minute, Doctor Barry Laverty, I&#x2019;m on call.&#x201d; At least his nose tip was its usual plum colour.<br>&#x201c;Fine, Fingal.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;And Kinky knows where to find me if anything crops up.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s not at the reception?&#x201d; Barry was surprised.

A longtime associate of National Geographic, which initially published much of his work, Washburn is a pioneer of aerial surveying and photography, developing technology that is still in use. The book details his techniques and includes informative historical and biographical text by journalist Smith and long sections in Washburn's own words (including the story of Barbara Washburn, who nonchalantly takes a job as his first secretary at the Museum of Science and then spends the next half-century as Brad's full-fledged partner in adventure and exploration). But the stars of the show are the 100 b&amp;w photos and maps: aside from boyhood and personal photos, there are stunning glaciers, striking deserts-any earth formation that looks spectacular from a mountaintop is here. Yet the biographical material here is dominant enough that readers will have to care about mountaineering and aerial photographic history as lived by Washburn. <br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Raven: A Trickster Tale from the Pacific Northwest</h2><p>Raven, the Native American trickster, feels sorry for those who must live in darkness, and he decides to help.

Below it, the knuckles of an elephant loomed in the same yellow light as a full moon eased to its zenith, bathing the scene in golden rays almost as bright as daylight. I tapped Volker lightly for the owl-eye, and pointed it over the top of the black .375 Magnum rifle. It rasped slightly against the dry salt on my cheeks as I focused the device and looked through the lenses. Edged in green, the light it drew was astonishing, each blade of the Kalahari-withered grass as sharp as a sword and each jagged stick of bush plated with the same winter-weary edging. In a silent click, I turned off the battery element and quietly handed it back to Volker. He took it with exaggerated slowness and carefully placed it on his lap without turning his head in the least. Far, far away, I could hear a bushbaby crying on the hot, dry night air, and once there was the closer yap of a black-backed jackal, slicing the cooler wind like a serrated bread knife. From almost a mile away came a quiet cough from the Bushman encampment at Naneh, where perhaps fifty souls lay sleeping by the fires in a swelter of sweat and heat. Certainly they were no hotter than we were, I thought as I eased my bum slightly on the canvas seat of a camp chair inside the blind and collected a black glance from Volker. Above, a satellite drifted as silently as the stars across the gem-filled sky, coming from our left and dying out of sight to our right. I wondered whose it was. Could it <i>really</i> see a golf ball at two hundred miles? Who would want to see a golf ball so far away, anyway? My brain scrambled and I furtively fished out my watch from the little pocket I had always questioned the use of. Ten past one. Good. Another fifty minutes before it was my turn to stare at that fool tree thatmight sprout a monster dog-and-cow-killing leopard. I closed my eyes after a glance at Volker, who was hunkered like a huge heap on the edge of his chair, and was figuring out how to spend all that money from the Pulitzer Prize when I felt it ... . It spoke for itself, a thick, strong grip that actually hurt my upper arm. I knew better than to react, just sliding my eyes open an almond sliver and staring straight ahead. I started to shift forward, but the grip increased along with several damned painful tightenings from the huge hand that had grabbed me. Slowly I went over our signals. One nudge or grip meant that the watcher had seen the leopard on the ground, but there was no change in the sere, sandy northern Kalahari that separated us from the tree. Two squeezes or pulses mean that the leopard was in the tree. No, again. But what in hell did a very solid and sustained grip mean? Oh, my! Maybe snake? We had seen several mambas and caught two puff adders already, but as far as I could see there were none on the floor of the blind, which vastly decreased my sense of immediate foreboding. But what the hell <i>was</i> it? I eased my eyes to Volker's furry face, the moon catching in the silver whiskers of his full beard. He sensed my movement, slight though it was, and tightened with the definite message that I was not to move again. Kee-rist, maybe it <i>was</i> a snake! Oh, unspeakables! What do I do now? I looked again out the small gun port where the custom .375 H&amp;H by Musgrave was supported by twin V-sticks, but saw nothing. The moon streamed down as if it were melting, but I could see nothing. The dog was intact. The elephant meat had not been touched. There was nothing between us and the tree. So <i>what?</i> Quietly, I eased my glance toward Volker. He was staring straight out of my porthole of the tent and bush blind. But at what? I looked again. Dammit, when they built this mother they should have left a clear view instead of letting that blob of branches or whatsis partially obscure my seeing hole! Damn! But then it hit me. The blob had not been there before. What the hell was it? Without looking again, I knew ... . I sat in frozen shock for perhaps a second, at which pointit was time to consider my options. I could see the home papers now: IDIOT HUNTER KILLED IN LEOPARD BLIND! Or maybe BUNGLING BWANA BASHED? Perhaps an upper-class, more niggardly headline would shout, NITWIT AUTHOR INGESTED. Yet, as I stared at the blob about three feet from my nose, I started to get the idea that perhaps Volker and I could bring a weapon to bear before what was obviously a lioness could tear apart the outer tent and kill us. For once I was beginning to agree with Volker that the idea of using tents as blind foundation wasn't so crazy after all. She was no more than a yard away, now that I focused on her. Motionless, she stared in as hard as we stared out. As I am sure Grellmann's brain had done, I went over our arsenal mentally. Let's see ... . There was the .375, but we could never get it off the V-posts in time to get a shot from inside a zipped tent. There was the .470 Nitro Express elephant gun, a side-by-side double out of Famars by Champlin, which was loaded with solid bullets and which would sure do the trick, but it would make too much noise to ease it from its propped-up position in my corner of the canvas. There was always the shotgun, stoked with No. 1 buck, but it was behind me, and the lioness was looking at me from a yard away. Volker had his old .458 Winchester as well as a shotgun, but what he didn't tell me at the time--perhaps he himself had forgotten--was that he had a .44 Magnum revolver that I had never seen, possibly kept in case I didn't pay my bill. I didn't know about the revolver, and all of the other arms were too noisy to move, so I figured we could do little else but look back at what I was sure was an astonished lioness. On second thought, perhaps she had not been able to make out what we were. I certainly hoped so. She was far too close for comfort. But she was close enough to study. She had a strange head, less linear and more blocky than that of the usual lioness, and she had some odd markings on what I could see of her neck, sort of darker splotches in the moonlight. I wondered if she had brought along the family to the festivities, and hoped that she was a lone Jezebel out for an evening on her own. Actually, measuring the predicament, I figured that we could get one oranother of the guns free before she ripped off the tent face. But, then, maybe we couldn't. If she attacked the front of the tent, maybe all the weapons would end up under folds of canvas and we would be left to show and tell. A brace of eternities drifted by without a move from either party when, in an instant, she doubled like a horizontal, greased Indian Rope Trick and faded away to the rear of the tent/blind. Unfortunately, a soft sound of a heavy body in dry leaves whispered like a cobra, and if you strained, you could hear her harsh breathing on the hot night air. Volker took his hand away, and the blood started to circulate in my arm again. There were things over the next two hours I did think of, but sleep wasn't one of them. When we were sure--or at least when I was sure--that the lioness wouldn't come back, I leaned over to Volker and whispered that there was sure no hope of the village-raiding leopard coming that night, what with that lioness around. He looked at me kind of queerly, but obviously had decided to pack it in anyway. After all, we had been hunting elephant all day in what were at least 115-degree temperatures, and to have lasted until 4:00 A.M. was a pretty good showing. That was twenty-three hours of various hunting, after all. He picked up his shotgun, and I heard the nasty metal sound as the safety was disengaged under his finger, and he eased out the side of the tent flap. He had a broad look around while I gathered up more weapons than the D-Day invasion toted and squeezed out beside him. He loomed over me like a strange, golden ostrich over a plover. "Now," he said in his kindliest tone, the one he used with imbeciles, "What's this about lionesses?" "But surely you saw her?" I asked incredulously. "Christ, she was practically a boarder! You mean you didn't see her?" "I saw the biggest leopard I ever saw in my life, but I didn't see any lionesses. Did you think ..." "Naw," I said, mentally scrambling for some arguing space. "I was just asking what you saw. Big one, wasn't she? Uh, I mean <i>him?</i>" "By the spoor alone, he's got to go over eight feet, maybecloser to nine. <i>Ach!</i> The biggest goddam leopard I ever saw ... ." He took the checkered black five-cell torch from my hand and swept it around the perimeter of the opening and then to the ground near the front of the blind. For a couple of seconds it stayed on the dead dog and flickered down to the elephant foot. Then he swept the sandy earth with the beam and gave a low whistle. "Never saw prints like these. He's as big as a lioness, I'll give you that. But look here. No question it was a male leopard." I looked. And blinked. They were leopard pugs, okay. Imagine that the sonofabitch had been too <i>close</i> to shoot! "Maybe from my angle I had a better look at him than you did out of your corner," said Volker, striding off in his usual giant-killing steps to the bush track that led back to the car. "But I'll tell you this--he won't be back again. He's had a good whiff of us. No way he'll come back." It was a long ride home, perhaps an hour, as false dawn gave an odd, ethereal edge to the outlines of the fluttering nightjars, sooty wraiths that flushed from just ahead of the tires. Owls flickered alongside the hunting car, picking up startled mice. We saw the tiny, bloodshot eyes of the main camp at Klein Dobe just as dawn really started trying. Already the camp staff were up in the growing light, starting cooking fires and brewing coffee for them that takes it. Personally, an icy beer would have fulfilled my wildest dreams. And so it did. I creaked from the freezer--which doesn't <i>really</i> freeze anything in the Eastern Bushmanland heat--to our tent, where I gave a rousing Fiona a somewhat-less-than-Hollywood kiss. "Did you get him?" she asked. A single look told her that her boy needed a little bit of head-patting. "Not exactly," I said mysteriously. "I could have taken one hell of a lioness, but she was too close." When the shower water had turned from roan to semi-clear and I had blown the roosting detritus out of my mustache, I wandered down to a nauseatingly jolly breakfast. Even Volker was there, placing a flanking movement on enough eggs and sausage to keep a Bushman clan solvent. Guinea fowl were churring down by the water point, anda lovesick shrike was competing with the weaver birds for notice in an unnoticing world. I felt like something you kick sand over and quietly walk away from. "Let's saddle up," said Phil, obstreperous as ever. "Want to catch these few minutes of proper light." "Yeah," agreed Robert Olkowski. "Let's push off." "Look, why don't you guys go to the game reserve or someplace today? I don't feel photogenic. Run along and play with your lenses, humm?" An egg I had chosen from the fried pile was looking at me quite unkindly. "Hey," said Phil, bright-eyed from a decent night's sleep without my snoring to keep the lions away, "I thought we were here to take pictures of you, Bwana." "Yeah," Roger chimed in. "Do you wanna make this video or not?" I considered the blissful alternative, then thought of Ken Wilson and all his hungry brood. "You mean you want to keep after that elephant we tracked yesterday? Talk some sense into these neophytes, Volker." I put the egg's eye out with a single slash of my fork. It flowed down the white perimeter, orange and injured. "Not for me to decide if you shirk your duty or not," said Volker helpfully. "If you don't want to go out, despite the bucks you are paying, I would be happier in my bed." Nice guy, Volker. What I need is another Volker. "Of course," he said around several bushels of bacon, "maybe this is a hundred-pounder. Who knows until we have caught up with him?" Well, that settled it. I strapped on the ammo belt, snugged down my hat, and went for my rifles. I beat everybody to the hunting vehicle, but it was not discovered until I was a couple of miles out of camp that I was still barefoot. &nbsp; <br> &nbsp; <br> It was a great year for safari, 1989, considering that I was not a professional hunter anymore. In June, I had gone with old pal Mick Arsenault of Dallas--at the time--and frozen my nevermindoff for two weeks in a steel rondaval on a Namibian ranch while Mick collected two excellent gemsbuck, the giant southern oryx, as well as taking a left and a right on bull kudu. Now, what do you say to a guy who has doubled on two excellent kudu? Right. Nothing. Not hunting big game, I was loath to climb the junior Himalayas on the Gobabis ranch, but had a wonderful time with a tame Bushman named Fritz hunting dassies, rock rabbits, or hyrax, whatever you want to call the woodchuck-sized critters that seethe through the most inhospitable cliffs of south-central Namibia. I also had some of the finest birdshooting of my life in company with Mick and Gary Haselau, another old friend, shooting (at) the very fast and very thirsty Namaqua sand grouse that are in the millions in the area. I developed a recoil scar on my right shoulder that will follow me to the crematorium, and I will show it to anyone who asks how the birdshooting is in Namibia. We shot at a couple of the few water holes where the sand grouse drink, and there were so many birds that we didn't beat them up very badly at all. Of course, there are bag limits, but they are generous. After a while, we only shot at birds that would fall into a specific circle of twenty-five yards, if that gives you some idea of the shooting quality. After my trip with Mick--garnished with the beauty of Cape Town and its seafood--I had a twenty-one-day trip called the Dunn's Celebrity Safari, which took place in Botswana with Gordon Cundill's firm, Hunters Africa. The idea was that I would host the clients from their arrival in Johannesburg until their departure, which worked out very well. Among the hunters were Dr. Bruce Melrose, who mostly hunted with my old buddy George Hoffman, John and Mary Dicken of Tennessee, who have become old pals, and Frank Stallone, brother of Sylvester. John Northcote, who arguably holds the greatest tenure of all practicing professional hunters in Africa, hunted John and Mary Dicken to a terrific collection of trophies, whereas Gordon Cundill Hisself floated through the safari going out, as I did, with Frank Stallone, Bruce Melrose, and the Dickens. Actually, it was a bang-up trip, and everybodytook lion--or could have--Frank Stallone deciding that he really shouldn't kill his birth sign despite long tracking of three superb, platinum-maned males, which were finally caught up with. Peter Hepburn, one of the best professional hunters I have ever seen, took Frank under his wing with Tony Colagreco, a Californian restaurant entrepreneur who was along to observe. The problem was that the Celebrity Safari finished up on September 23, and I was to go to Windhoek and Bushmanland in the very early hours of the twenty-fifth of the same month. Yet, thanks to Fifi, all clients--now friends--were properly accommodated in the Sandton Sun Hotel and seen off. Incidentally, if you ever come to South Africa, I recommend you choose a "fringe" hotel, as the downtown area of Johannesburg has become positively dangerous with street crime.

The novel presents Stephen King as a writer experimenting with style and narrative, time and perspective. Fans looking for a skin-crawling, page-turning fright or an undead bloodbath will be disappointed, but a patient reader willing to savor King's leisurely study of character and island life will find many rewards. And all of this is not to say that the book is without suspense.<p> The story unfolds in one continuous chapter, told in the first person by the cranky, 65-year-old housekeeper, Dolores, who is explaining to police officers and a stenographer how and why she killed her husband, Joe, 30 years ago. At the same time, in her rambling monologue, she insists that she did <i>not</i> kill her longtime employer, Vera Donovan--notwithstanding what the residents of Little Tall Island may be whispering. Joe was a drinker, and, as Dolores gradually argues, he deserved to die for the horrifying crimes he committed against his family. But Vera, despite her cantankerous disposition as a lady governing her decaying estate with her precise rules about even the most mundane household chore ("Six pins! Remember to use six pins! Don't you let the wind blow my good sheets down to the corner of the yard!"), was a good woman--or at least not an evil one. She was the woman who hired the young Dolores and kept her on even after Dolores got pregnant again. Dolores cleaned and cared for her even as the old matron faded into senility.</p><p> <i>Dolores Claiborne</i> is a rich novel that recalls the regionalist writing of the turn of the century. It is a fine place for a skeptical newcomer--put off by King's reputation for outright terror--to start. And for fans, it is a book that offers new insights into an author who's an old favorite. <i>--Patrick O'Kelley</i></p><b>Stephen King</b> lives in Maine and Florida with his wife, novelist Tabitha King.

His praise was echoed by other reviewers and by readers, who embraced the book as they might a displaced person in one of Malamud's stories, now returned to us, complete and fulfilled and recognized at last. The volume gathers together fifty-five stories, from "Armistice" (1940) to "Alma Redeemed" (1984), and including the immortal stories from The Magic Barrel and the vivid depictions of the unforgettable Fidelman. It is a varied and generous collection of great examples of the modern short story, which Malamud perfected, and an ideal introduction to the work of this great American writer.<br></p><p>Due to his formidable skill as a novelist--and to the fact that one of his novels, <i>The Natural</i>, had the good or bad luck to be repackaged as a large-screen vehicle for Robert Redford--Bernard Malamud hasn't always been recognized as short-story master of the first rank. As this collection demonstrates once and for all, he is. The anthology pieces, such as "The Magic Barrel," "The Silver Dish," or "Rembrandt's Hat," would be more than enough to place the author in the pantheon. But the 54 stories gathered here represent an astonishing abundance of narrative smarts and brilliant, Yiddish-accented prose. Malamud's heroes meet all manner of misfortune--there's something distinctly Job-like about even his most contented characters (a typical one has "a sort of indigenous sadness [that] hung on or around him")--yet the author suffuses their woes with gentle comedy. And while Jews occupy center stage in almost every tale, they are universal rather than parochial figures: as the beleaguered tailor in "Angel Levine" triumphantly informs his wife, "Believe me, there are Jews everywhere."Acclaimed for his short stories, Bernard Malamud (1914-1986) received two National Book Awards (for <i>The Magic Barrel</i> and the novel <i>The Fixer</i>) and the Pulitzer Prize (for <i>The Fixer</i>).

But cultural provocateur Kathleen Parker, who was raised by her father and who mothered a pack of boys, makes a humorous case for rescuing the allegedly stronger sex from trends that portend man&#x2019;s cultural demise. <br><i><br>Save the Males</i> is a shrewd, amusing, and sure-to-be-controversial look at how men, maleness, and fatherhood have been under siege in American culture for decades. Kathleen Parker argues that the feminist movement veered off course from its original aim of helping women achieve equality and ended up making enemies of men.

Give that boy a lifetime pass to The Vagina Monologues.<br>Fourteen years isn&#x2019;t long to roam the earth, but boys learn early that they belong to the &#x201c;bad&#x201d; sex and their female counterparts to the &#x201c;good.&#x201d; For many, their indoctrination starts the moment they begin school and observe that teachers (who are, for the most part, females) prefer less rambunctious girl behavior. Boys&#x2019; programming continues through high school and then into college, where male students are often treated to an orientation primer in sexual harassment and date rape. A friend&#x2019;s son attended one such seminar on his first day at Harvard. &#x201c;It scared the s&#x2014;&#x2014; out of him,&#x201d; his father reported. &#x201c;He said, &#x2018;Dad, I&#x2019;m never going on a date.&#x2019;&#x201d;<br><br>Smart lad.<br><br>America is a dangerous place for males these days. Look at a girl the wrong way&#x2014;or the right way, if you&#x2019;re a gal of a certain age (why do you think all those fifty-year-old women are flocking to Italy?)&#x2014;and you&#x2019;ll get slapped. With an open palm if you&#x2019;re lucky; with a lawsuit if you&#x2019;re not. Or worse, a visit to Human Resources for reprogramming. Misinterpret her body language and you might wind up in prison.<br><br>The first hint for Jackson and other boys of the now twentysomething generation that life wasn&#x2019;t going to be precisely fair was when, beginning in 1993, they were told that girls would be getting out of school for &#x201c;Take Our Daughters to Work Day,&#x201d; a creation of the Ms. Foundation for Women and possibly the daffiest idea ever dreamed up in the powder room. This is ancient history now, but not irrelevant to sexual relations today. The familiar premise was that girls needed to visit the working world in order to visualize themselves in nontraditional roles. If they saw women only in the home, where more-traditional mothers presumably spent their days watching soaps and seducing the gardener, how could they grow up to be firemen, jet pilots, and Harvard scientists?<br><br>But there was more to the Ms. mission than role modeling. The subtext was that little girls would absorb the rage of their feminist foremothers and become militant grrrrrrls who could, by goddess, kick boy butt&#x2014;anytime, anywhere. Marie C. Wilson, a former Ms. Foundation president, put it this way: &#x201c;When girls came into offices, factories, and firehouses, we knew they would see opportunities for their future, but we also anticipated that girls would perceive inequities in the workplace and ask the hard questions that have no easy answers&#x2014;like why most of the bosses were men and can you have a family and work here, too?&#x201d;<br><br>Such feminist fantasies probably were not the burning agendas of nine- and ten-year-olds&#x2014;or even teenage daughters&#x2014;who more likely were tilting toward &#x201c;Is there a mall near here?&#x201d; It was assumed, meanwhile, that boys would have no such visionary problems, given that they saw men in professional and other working roles on a daily basis. The feminist narrative, now firmly entrenched in the culture at large, was that boys could afford to stay behind and learn the lesson that would shadow them into adulthood: that they are unfairly privileged by virtue of their maleness, and they will be punished for it.<br><br>After a few years of protest from agenda-free parents who had sons as well as daughters, the girls-only day was tweaked in 2003 to include boys under the broader title of &#x201c;Take Our Daughters and Sons to Work Day&#x201d;&#x2014;a nice gesture, if too late for a generation of boys who had obediently absorbed the message that males were guilty for being male and females were entitled to, oh, everything.<br><br>Or had they?<br><br>More likely, boys had absorbed the message that life isn&#x2019;t fair and that girls are to blame. Girls weren&#x2019;t really to blame, obviously, but kids will be kids. Nobody likes a teacher&#x2019;s pet, and girls were the culture&#x2019;s pets. We browbeat our kids about the importance of sharing and being nice, then one day the gender fairy flits into their lives and sprinkles cootie dust on all things male. Human nature being what it is, boys were unlikely to respond favorably to the news. Getting out of school for a day, after all, is otherwise known as playing hooky&#x2014;while staying behind with a female teacher, most likely a feminist herself, to have his brain chip tuned must be a little boy&#x2019;s idea of hell. I know it is mine.<br><br>That corporate America participated in the go-girl-play-hooky farce merely reflects how effective feminists had been. Men weren&#x2019;t about to protest when daughters began filing in for their state-sanctioned day of privilege. Men have daughters, too, after all. They wanted to do the right thing, even if it was, in fact, the wrong thing for their sons.<br><br>If boys weren&#x2019;t perfectly clear on the specialness of girls, female teachers weaned on feminist ideology were poised to fill in the gaps. One of my son&#x2019;s middle school teachers studiously refused to use male pronouns, a curious tic I noticed during an orientation meeting. Every time a pronoun was required, she used she or her, never he or him, effectively erasing boys from the classroom. I sympathize with anyone wishing to avoid the awkward his/her construction. I also understand the inclination to alternate between the two&#x2014;his in one sentence, her in the next&#x2014;though such tortured pronoun equity becomes distracting and annoying. I even understand and often resort to the all-encompassing they and their, which gathers everyone under one gender-neutral third-person umbrella, offending no one and exalting the totality of Gender Oneness.<br><br>But Miss Andry, as we affectionately called this teacher en famille, went to the extreme of simply omitting the male sex altogether. Nothing subtle about that. He simply didn&#x2019;t exist for her, while She was everything a girl-teacher could want. Miss Andry made clear her preference for girls in other ways throughout the year. One memorable day, she brought doughnuts to class just for the girls. When my then eleven-year-old son asked why he couldn&#x2019;t have a doughnut, she said, &#x201c;Because I don&#x2019;t like boys.&#x201d; Glad we got that straight. To be fair, maybe it was &#x201c;Girls Day&#x201d; and Miss Andry was kidding, but little boys that age can be nuance-challenged. We would find it intolerable, certainly, if a male teacher said something similar to an eleven-year-old girl.<br><br>Teachers like Miss Andry most likely are products of the pro-girl education reform movement that captured America&#x2019;s imagination in the 1990s. Several books and studies emerged during that time claiming that education reinforced gender stereotypes that were damaging to girls. All those lessons about men drafting the U.S. Constitution and inventing electricity &#x2019;n&#x2019; stuff apparently harmed girls&#x2019; self-esteem. Where were the mothers of invention?<br><br>The Crisis Wars<br><br>The girl crisis got rolling in 1989, when Harvard professor Carol Gilligan claimed that her research showed girls suffered from a patriarchal educational system that favored boys and silenced girls. In her words: &#x201c;As the river of a girl&#x2019;s life flows into the sea of Western culture, she is in danger of drowning or disappearing.&#x201d; As a former girl, I&#x2019;m thinking: So speak up or swim, sister.<br><br>Feminist groups whose existence was predicated on the victimhood of women quickly embraced the girl crisis meme. No crisis, no ism, no research funds. Gilligan&#x2019;s claims were followed by a report from the American Association of University Women called Shortchanging Girls, Shortchanging America that spoke of the unacknowledged American tragedy of esteem-bereft girls. Then in 1994, journalist Peggy Orenstein published Schoolgirls, about girls&#x2019; lack of confidence in school owing to the &#x201c;hidden curriculum&#x201d; that girls should be quiet and subordinate to boys.<br><br>Next came Mary Pipher&#x2019;s 1994 bestseller, Reviving Ophelia: Saving the Selves of Adolescent Girls, in which she described America&#x2019;s &#x201c;girl-destroying&#x201d; culture. A clinical psychologist, Pipher claimed that girls in early adolescence take a dive, losing the confidence of girlhood and becoming mysteriously sullen and self-absorbed. We used to call this &#x201c;the teenage years,&#x201d; but suddenly we needed to restructure education to deal with girls who allegedly were lagging behind boys owing to the onset of puberty.<br><br>By these descriptions, one would have thought that girls were being shackled to desks (constructed to resemble kitchen stoves) and their mouths duct-taped shut. Congress came to the rescue with the Gender Equity in Education Act, and a new million-dollar industry was born to study gender bias in America&#x2019;s schools. By 1995, the girl crisis was considered so severe that American delegates to the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing made girls&#x2019; low self-esteem a human rights issue.<br><br>You can&#x2019;t help admiring the momentum. In just five years, the germ of an idea had become a full-blown movement. Girls had to be saved! No doubt Chinese women, who risk being shot for shouting &#x201c;Democracy!&#x201d; in a crowded theater, were amused to hear American women bemoaning the sad girls back home suf...</p><h2>The Llama&#39;s Secret - A Peruvian Legend (Legends of the World)</h2><p>A Peruvian rendition of the Great Flood story, in which a llama warns the people and animals to seek shelter on Huillcacato to avoid the rising sea, Mamacocha.</p><p></p><h2>That&#39;s Easy for You to Say!</h2><p><i>That's Easy for You to Say!</i> includes the acceptable pronunciation of every proper name in every major translation of the Bible.

Within a world torn apart by ideological tyranny and war, Grossman's characters must work out their destinies. Chief among these are the members of the Shaposhnikov family - Lyudmila, a mother destroyed by grief for her dead son; Viktor, her scientist-husband who falls victim to anti-semitism; and Yevgenia, forced to choose between her love for the courageous tank-commander Novikov and her duty to her former husband. Life and Fate is one of the great Russian novels of the 20th century, and the richest and most vivid account there is of what the Second World War meant to the Soviet Union.Vasily Grossman was born in 1905. In 1941, he became a war reporter for the Red Army newspaper Red Star and came to be regarded as a legendary war hero. <i>Life and Fate,</i> his masterpiece, was considered a threat to the totalitarian regime, and Grossman was told that there was no chance of the novel being published for another 200 years.

Today the coun-try has become one of the most dynamic regions on earth. That sense of time&#x2014;the contrast between past and present, and the rhythms that emerge in a vast, ever-evolving country&#x2014;is brilliantly illuminated by Peter Hessler in <em>Oracle Bones</em>, a book that explores the human side of China's transformation. </p><p>Hessler tells the story of modern-day China and its growing links to the Western world as seen through the lives of a handful of ordinary people. In addition to the author, an American writer living in Beijing, the narrative follows Polat, a member of a forgotten ethnic minority, who moves to the United States in searchof freedom; William Jefferson Foster, who grew up in an illiterate family and becomes a teacher; Emily,a migrant factory worker in a city without a past; and Chen Mengjia, a scholar of oracle-bone inscriptions, the earliest known writing in East Asia, and a man whosetragic story has been lost since the Cultural Revolution. All are migrants, emigrants, or wanderers who find themselves far from home, their lives dramatically changed by historical forces they are struggling to understand.</p><p>Peter Hessler excavates the past and puts a remarkable human face on the history he uncovers. In a narrative that gracefully moves between the ancient and the present, the East and the West, Hessler captures the soul of a country that is undergoing a momentous change before our eyes.</p></p><p><p>Peter Hessler is a staff writer at <em>The New Yorker</em>, where he served as the Beijing correspondent from 2000 to 2007, and is also a contributing writer for <em>National Geographic</em>. He is the author of<em> River Town</em>, which won the Kiriyama Prize; <em>Oracle Bones</em>, which was a finalist for the National Book Award; and, most recently, <em>Country Driving</em>. He won the 2008 National Magazine Award for excellence in reporting, and he was named a MacArthur Fellow in 2011. He lives in Cairo.</p>Near the beginning of Peter Hessler's new book about China, Oracle Bones, an archaeology team drills small holes in a field in Anyang, looking for the walls of an ancient settlement. Every core sample they remove is examined for signs of buried structures or artifacts that will help the archaeologists understand what's beneath the surface. "The dirt plugs reflect the meaning of what lies below," Hessler writes. "They are like words that can be recognized at a glance." <p>Hessler's book is like a collection of those core samples. He starts at the boundaries -- a trader from China's far west, a worker in the southern city of Shenzhen, a visit to the northeast border with North Korea -- and works his way in. Like artifacts discovered by an archaeologist, Hessler's tales are fragments that acquire meaning when taken together: a migrant worker, a dynamic teacher from an illiterate family, a black-market money trader from the Uighur ethnic minority, an aging man who fights a losing legal battle to save his historic courtyard house, a movie star on location in a remote part of Xinjiang province. Only gradually does the reader gain an understanding of the people trying to find their way in this vast country at a time of almost unfathomable change.</p><p>Hessler is the New Yorker's first accredited correspondent in China since before the communist revolution. He went to China to work in the Peace Corps and published a book about that experience called River Town. Some of his former students appear again in Oracle Bones, offering unusual insights into the yearnings and frustrations of the country's young adults.</p><p>One of the book's main pleasures is its language; Hessler writes clearly and sympathetically. Of the English teacher who broke the spines of dictionaries with heavy use, he says: "He still kept the old books lined up on his shelf, the way a good infielder never throws away a worn-out glove." Of the view from a tower on the Great Wall, where he camped overnight during one of China's notorious dust storms, Hessler writes: "From the tower, I watched it come in. Clouds of brown hung low to the ground, like the tendrils of a living thing that crept into the valley." </p><p>Unfortunately, like any excavation, the book sometimes lacks direction. At one point, he takes a gratuitous shot at Beijing-based newspaper journalists. (His disparaging description of foreign correspondents bears little resemblance to what I saw when I worked there and even less to what I've read about since.) </p><p>But for the most part, Hessler moves engagingly back and forth between narratives and characters, including a Uighur money-changer in Beijing who eventually receives political asylum in the United States and winds up delivering food for a D.C. Asian restaurant. His former students also prove invaluable in explaining today's China. One takes a job in a factory in Shenzhen, a one-time agricultural area that has been exploding with industrial growth since the early 1990s. Through her, he describes the underside of China's economic miracle: lecherous managers, late-night radio advice chats and petty rivalries among workers.</p><p>Perhaps Hessler's most compelling character is one who has been dead for 40 years. Born in 1911, Chen Mengjia was publishing popular poetry by age 18 under the name Wanderer. "I crushed my chest and pulled out a string of songs," he wrote. During the Japanese occupation, he joined the resistance. Later he became a professor, and a Rockefeller Foundation grant took him to America, accompanied by his brilliant wife, an expert on Henry James. In America, Chen studied Chinese bronzes in U.S. collections. He and his wife returned to China just as the communists took over. Soon, his erudite book on Chinese bronzes was published under the title Our Country's Shang and Zhou Bronzes Looted by American Imperialists. Communist China turned out to be an inhospitable place for a person so attached to the past. In 1957, Chen was labeled a rightist for opposing government attempts to simplify the Chinese language's gloriously rococo characters. In 1966, he committed suicide.</p><p>One of Chen's interests was oracle bones, which come to fascinate Hessler too. Made of cattle shoulder blades or turtle undershells, the oracle bones were heated until they cracked, making a sound that supposedly captured voices from departed ancestors. The cracks were then interpreted by diviners or the king himself. </p><p>Tracing Chen's story takes Hessler to the United States, Taiwan, Anyang, Shanghai and Beijing. He interviews aging archaeologists and the small fraternity of oracle-bone experts. In doing so, he unearths moving stories of the betrayal and pain that China's intellectuals endured from the communist victory through Mao's vicious Cultural Revolution.

She paused, surveying it, her pulse accelerating with maidenly excitement. She was here; could she handle the three Challenges? She knew they would be possible but not easy.<br>Suddenly her Question seemed foolishly inadequate. She really didn't need to bother Magician Humfrey with it; there was one sure way to get the answer on her own. The trouble was, that way was dangerous. If she proved to be unlucky, she could regret it for the rest of her life. So she could not afford to gamble; she had to know before she married Che Centaur.<br>She spread her fair white wings and leaped into the air. She had been trotting, perhaps to give herself more time to think, but now she would fly in before she had a chance to change her timid mind again. After all, centaurs weren't supposed to be femalishly irresolute. They were supposed to be intelligent and decisive. She had been a centaur only half her life, or one-third of it, or five-sixths of it, depending on how she chose to see it at the moment. She was still learning.<br>The castle looked deceptively placid. The tower windows were open, the moat was calm, and the drawbridge was down. Just as if anyone could walk right in. Well, there was one way to make proof of that.<br>Cynthia Centaur glided to a four-hoof landing, folded her wings, and trotted up to the drawbridge. Sure enough, it lifted just before she got there. Unsurprised, she walked down the bank to the water. As her fore-hoof touched it, colored fins appeared. Loan sharks. She backed off; she did not want to let them take an arm or a leg. There would be no swimming today.<br>She spread her wings and leaped. The feathers found no purchase; she landed back on the ground. She nodded, having confirmed another limit. She could not walk, swim, or fly across the moat. It was a Challenge.<br>So what was the way? There had to be something likely but difficult, and she would have to figure out how to make it work: That was the way of it. The Good Magician did not like to be bothered with frivolous Questions, so he made it awkward for querents to get in to ask them. Then they had to pay a year's service, or the equivalent, for the Answers. Even so, there seemed to be a fairly constant stream of them. Many of them worked off their Services by becoming parts of Challenges for later comers. So it amounted to a cottage industry.<br>None of which helped her to cross the moat. What had Magician Humfrey cooked up for her? For the Challenges tended to relate to the abilities of the ones whose progress they barred. It would require centaur savvy to get through.<br>She walked around the moat, seeking some hint. All was quiet. Until she was halfway: 180� in precise centaur terminology. There she saw a rope supported by a system of pulleys on either side of the moat. One end was attached to a small boat at the outer bank, and another end was in the hands of a lovely human woman.<br>"Ahoy there, centaur!" the woman cried. "Do you mean to anger?"<br>"Why, no," Cynthia said, surprised. "Am I somehow giving offense?"<br>"Frustrate, interfere, balk, thwart, oppose-"<br>"Cross?"<br>"Whatever," the woman replied crossly. "Do you intend to navigate this moat?"<br>"Why, hello, Demoness Metria!" Cynthia said. "Are you operating this Challenge?"<br>"Yes, I'm stuck here until I help someone get across. If you want to come in, get in the boat and I'll haul you over."<br>"But I weigh a lot more than you do," Cynthia protested. "It would be difficult for you to pull me."<br>"That's why I have the pulley. It gives me the magic of buy."<br>"Of what?"<br>"Shop, browse, patronize, bargain, purchase--"<br>Cynthia fixed on the last word. "Leverage?"<br>"Whatever. Get in the stupid boat. I'll use the crastination to haul you across."<br>Crastination? Cynthia hesitated to inquire. It was probably the name for the fancy pulley. She wasn't sure about this, but nothing better offered, so she set four feet in the boat and hunkered down so as not to tip it over. This was hardly her most comfortable mode of passage, but of course the Challenges were not designed to be comfortable.<br>Metria pulled on her rope. It swung her halfway across the moat. Cynthia's boat hardly budged.<br>"!!" the demoness swore up, down, and sideways. The water beneath her bubbled and clouded as if abruptly heated.<br>"I think I'm still too heavy for you," Cynthia said.<br>"You're <i>not</i> too heavy! I'm just too amateurish. I can't get it right."<br>Obviously true. Cynthia watched as Metria swung back to her side of the moat and landed on the bank. "Maybe if you pulled it more slowly, to get more leverage?"<br>The demoness pulled more slowly--and was hauled across the moat even faster, "!!" The green grass around her wilted and turned brown.<br>"I am not sure this is working," Cynthia said delicately. "Perhaps if I looked for some other way to get across--"<br>The demoness vanished from the outer moat bank in a puff of vile smoke and reappeared at the inner bank, rope still in hand. "Absotively posilutely not! I am supposed to haul your donkey rear across this fetid pool of snot, and I shall do it if it vetoes us all." Now steam rose from the water, and chips flaked from the castle wall behind her. What little vegetation remained in the area gave up the ghost; little plant-shaped spirits were floating into the sky.<br>Cynthia's maidenly ears were hurting. She had never before seen a demon quite this enraged, and wasn't sure she would survive with her health if it got any worse. She decided not to argue. "Of course, Metria," she said soothingly. "It will surely work out."<br>"It had <i>better</i> moil out," the demoness gritted wrathfully, "or I might become annoyed." Thin plumes of smoke jetted from her ears, and veins stood out in stark red relief on the crackling surfaces of her eyeballs.<br>This was still beneath the level of annoyance? Three of Cynthia's knees felt weak, and the fourth was none too strong. She had to pacify Metria before she exploded, destroying the whole castle. Obviously the present approach wasn't working. The demoness did not seem to know how to operate the pulley correctly, but surely would not be amenable to suggestions by an outsider. How could this be handled posilutely--oops, positively?<br>Maybe if she reverted to basics. "Metria, I'm sure there's some mistake, and something is interfering with your effort. Maybe if we explore this from the start, we can find out what's happening."<br>"Maybe," the demoness snorted. A little smoke ring spun clear of her nose, expanding as it floated across the moat. The fin of a blue shark sliced through it--and the fin blistered before it hastily submerged.<br>So far so good. "Now, I am somewhat inexperienced about demonly matters, and perhaps my vocabulary is deficient. You mentioned a crastination, which I assumed to be the pulley. Possibly I am in error." It galled her to say this, because true centaurs were seldom in error, and their vocabularies were never deficient.<br>Metria laughed. Waves of heat rippled outward from her; the rage was dissipating. "Maybe I misspoke. I am trying to use the pulley to keep me here while I pull you across. I am trying to crastinate, so I can stay here long enough to find out what is so infernally important about your quest."<br>"But there's nothing important about me or my quest," Cynthia said. "I just want to find out whether my offspring will breed true. You see, I'm not a natural centaur; Magician Trent transformed me from human eighty years ago. So my children might turn out human, instead of winged centaur. I can't face the threat of such a horror, so I must find out before the fact."<br>"That's right; I remember now," Metria said. "You tried to fool the Magician, and he was diseased."<br>"He was what?"<br>"Instead of being at ease, he was--"<br>"Oh. Not eased. Perturbed."<br>"Whatever," the demoness agreed crossly. "So he punished you."<br>"Yes. But now I like being a winged monster, and I love Che Centaur, and I want to be sure that when I marry him I'll be able to do my part. But however important that may be to me personally, I recognize that in the larger scheme of the cosmos, it is inconsequential. So it must be some other quest that is the one you want."<br>"No, you are the only querent scheduled for today, so it has to be you. Humfrey's in such a dither he didn't even notice how I'm subbing for Demon Tension in the Challenge. I'm the most curious of demonesses, and I've just got to know what's so awful it can make even the Good Magician get all up in a heaval. So I have to get you into the castle, not me out of it. Until my oddity is sated."<br>"Your what is sated?"<br>"Eccentric, irregularity, peculiarity, abnormality, quirk--"<br>"Curiosity?"<br>"Whatever! So I gather you don't even know what's so important about your Question."<br>"Well, it's important to <i>me</i>. But I think not to many others. Does it seem important to you?"<br>"No. Who cares whether your baby is a stinkweed? So it must be something else. I've just got to know."<br>Cynthia was beginning to be just the merest suggestion of concerned. The Good Magician was dithered about her Question? It was true that if the Answer turned out to be negative, she would have to seriously consider not marrying Che, which would break both their hearts, but since when did Humfrey care about centaur hearts? She hardly rated any such concern. "I fear you will be disappointed. But I'll be happy to share my Answer with you, at such time as I obtain it. Then you can rest undisgruntled."<br>"Rest how?"<br>"Calm, placid, peaceful, quiet, serene, tranquil--"<br>"That's six."<br>"I beg your pardon?"<br>"I usually give only five explications."<br>"Five whats?"<br>"Analogues, meanings, expressions, translations, identities--"<br>"Synonyms?"<br>"Whatever. You gave six. That damages the cadence. <i>I</i> should have filled in the sixth."<br>"I apologize." Actually Cynthia remembered her giving six on more than one prior occasion, but she didn't care to argue the case. "I meant merely to say that you can rest easy, once you know what I learn from the Good Magician."<br>"Well, why didn't you say so?" the demoness demanded crossly.<br>"I fear I got distracted. Now about this crastination: I remain unclear as to its precise application. How will crastination help you?"<br>"By delaying my departure, so I can overhear Humfrey's verdict. I'm trying to stall."<br>Cynthia nodded. "Perhaps the word you want is 'procrastination.'"<br>"Yes! That's it. I couldn't quite get it. 'Amateur crastination' was as close as I could come."<br>"And when an amateur does a job a professional should do, it can go wrong," Cynthia said.<br>"It can get downright bungled. I want to stand here and pull you across, using the--" She hesitated.<br>"Leverage."<br>"Of the pulley. Instead it's been reversing, leaving you slow while I zoom across the moat."<br>"Try it again, this time thinking pro instead of amateur."<br>Metria pulled on the rope. This time she remained in place, and Cynthia's boat slid smoothly across the moat. She had figured it out.<br>"Remember--you promised," the demoness said. "And souled folk keep their promises."<br>"I will tell you what I learn," Cynthia agreed. "Though I suspect it will disappoint you. Nothing about me or my concerns is important to Magicians or demons."<br>"We'll wash."<br>"We'll what?"<br>"Brine, water, pool, bay, ocean--"<br>"Sea?"<br>"Whatever." The demoness looked cross as she faded out.<br>"We'll see," Cynthia agreed with half a smile. There was something almost amusing about the demoness's problem with words. Was the Good Magician really unaware of Metria's presence? The Challenge seemed remarkably apt for this particular individual.<br>She stepped out of the boat and surveyed the castle. There was a door in the wall. She tried the handle, and it turned, and the door opened.<br>Beyond was a spacious chamber filled with harpies. They were dancing strutting in messy patterns. Feathers were flying, the walls were filthy, and the smell was appalling. No wonder: there was bird poop all over the floor, getting stirred up by the claws of the dancers. Cynthia stepped back, wrinkling her nose. Centaurs were natural about natural functions, but their manure was inoffensive and good for flowers. Harpy dung, in contrast, was truly nasty. It required special facilities for detoxification. To have it spread about a sealed chamber--that was dangerous.<br>But this seemed to be the only way into the castle. The first Challenge had been a test of her understanding; she had found the key word and thus gotten not muck about in their stools. Puns were the lowest form of humor in much the way buns were the lowest form of bread, and even buns had naughty connotations to make boys snicker. Puns brought worse reactions than snickering. So it was conceivable that an obscene dance might be called a foul ball. But puns were also the main avenue for changing things.<br>Suppose she thought of another meaning for ball? She concentrated--and in a moment the dancers rolled into one feculent mass, a huge sphere that squeezed the limits of the chamber. But there was no way to pass it; the ball blocked the way. So that was evidently not the answer. She relaxed her focus, and the ball dissolved back into dancing harpies, who seemed not to have noticed their brief transformation.<br>Then a dim bulb flashed just over her head. The other word--foul. That could also be fowl. This could be a fowl ball. Harpies resembled fowl, which were barnyard birds--chickens, ducks, turkeys, pheasants, and the like. But by a further extension, all winged monsters could be said to have an affinity, because of their wings. Even winged centaurs.<br>She concentrated, and the harpies became winged centaurs engaged in mannerly dancing, their hooves keeping the cadence. The stench became odor, and the odor became smell, and the smell became healthy centaur musk. Now the chamber was bearable.<br>She moved on in and joined the dance. It was the Centaur Stomp, and she loved it. In a moment a centaur stallion came to join her. The Stomp did not require partners, but there could be couples if they wanted to be. "May I join you?" he inquired politely. "I am Center Centaur."<br>"Join me to what?" she inquired in return, with a smile as she matched his hoofbeats.<br>He laughed. "I knew you were clever and nice," he said.<br>"Oh? How?"<br>"It is my talent. Insight. I can see inside a person and know what is wrong."<br>"Being clever and nice is what's wrong with me?"<br>"Yes, because these are nasty challenges that make you feel uncomfortable. You could handle them better if you had a trifle more meanness of spirit."<br>It was her turn to laugh. "That is a flattering liability."<br>"True. I regret that you are emotionally committed to another stallion. I will let you go now."<br>"Thank you." He was evidently not a challenge in himself, just a bit player who perhaps was not allowed to help her, but felt no need to be unpleasant. She appreciated that.<br>Then she got a sudden headache. That was weird; she hadn't had one of those in a long time. Was it part of the Challenge?<br>A filly caught her eye. "Oh, I'm sorry," she said. "It's my talent: causing random headaches within a set radius. I can't control it, but fortunately it is intermittent. Let me get clear of you, and you will be all right."...</p><h2>The Devil Is Here in These Hills: West Virginia&#39;s Coal Miners and Their Battle for Freedom</h2><p>From before the dawn of the 20th century until the arrival of the New Deal, one of the most protracted and deadly labor struggles in American history was waged in West Virginia. On one side were powerful corporations whose millions bought armed guards and political influence. On the other side were 50,000 mine workers, the nation&#x2019;s largest labor union, and the legendary miners&#x2019; angel,&#x201d; Mother Jones. The fight for unionization and civil rights sparked a political crisis verging on civil war that stretched from the creeks and hollows to the courts and the US Senate. In <i>The Devil is Here in These Hills</i>, celebrated labor historian James Green tells the story of West Virginia and coal like never before.<br><br>The value of West Virginia&#x2019;s coalfields had been known for decades, and after rail arrived in the 1870s, industrialists pushed fast into the wilderness, digging mines and building company towns where they wielded nearly complete control over everyday life. The state&#x2019;s high-quality coal drove American expansion and industrialization, but for tens of thousands of laborers, including boys as young as ten, mining life showed the bitter irony of the state motto, Mountaineers are Always Free.&#x201d; Attempts to unionize were met with stiff resistance. Fundamental rights were bent, then broken, and the violence evolved from bloody skirmishes to open armed conflict, as an army of miners marched to an explosive showdown. Extensively researched and told in vibrant detail, <i>The Devil is Here in These Hills</i> is the definitive book on an essential chapter in the history of American freedom.</p><p><b>James Green</b> is the author of five books, including <i>Death in the Haymarket: A Story of Chicago, the First Labor Movement and the Bombing that Divided Gilded Age America</i>.

As this masterful history demonstrates, the South was often a hotbed of unionism, poor women proved feisty and enduring adversaries, and remote hillbillies&#x2019; lived in one of the most industrialized regimes in the world. . . .

From Jane Austen to Salman Rushdie, from Yeats to media coverage of the Gulf War, &#34;Culture and Imperialism&#34; is a broad, fierce and wonderfully readable account of the roots of imperialism in European culture.</p><p>Edward Said makes one of the strongest cases ever for the aphorism, "the pen is mightier than the sword." This is a brilliant work of literary criticism that essentially becomes political science. <i>Culture and Imperialism</i> demonstrates that Western imperialism's most effective tools for dominating other cultures have been literary in nature as much as political and economic. He traces the themes of 19th- and 20th-century Western fiction and contemporary mass media as weapons of conquest and also brilliantly analyzes the rise of oppositional indigenous voices in the literatures of the "colonies." Said would argue that it's no mere coincidence that it was a Victorian Englishman, Edward G. Bulwer-Lytton, who coined the phrase "the pen is mightier . . ." Very highly recommended for anyone who wants to understand how cultures are dominated by words, as well as how cultures can be liberated by resuscitating old voices or creating new voices for new times.&#34;In Culture and Imperialism, Edward Said&#39;s immense erudition and interpretive audacity are brought to bear on a variety of literatures, reanimating the terms of his title and discovering, in the process, how some of the most revered cultural productions call upon the same energies that go into the building of empires. His new book will likely become a classic of contemporary criticism.&#34; --Richard Poirier</p><h2>Suzuki Piano School, Vol. 2</h2><p>Contents are: Ecossaise (J. N. Hummel) * A Short Story (H.

When she returned to her North Carolina roots with her artist-husband, Joe, she bagan a series based on her own background. The first book, BOOTLEGGER&#39;S DAUGHTER, because a Washington Post bestseller that swept the top mystery awards for its year and is among the 100 Favorite Mysteries of the Century as selected by the Independent Mystery Booksellers Association. Later Deborah Knott novels UP JUMPS THE DEVIL and STORM TRACK won the Agatha award for Best Novel.Academic rivalry, petty jealousy, greed, and revenge form the backdrop for Maron's detective story featuring NYPD cop Sigrid Harald. Riley Quinn, deputy chairman of the art department at New York's Vanderlyn College, dies a grotesquely painful death when he drinks coffee laced with potassium dichromate, and it's up to Sigrid to find out whodunit. There are plenty of suspects, among them a disgruntled student, a female colleague whose promotion he blocked, another colleague with whom Quinn's wife was having a blatant affair, and a Hungarian handyman whose uncle left all his paintings to Quinn--paintings that are now worth a fortune. Maron is better known for her Judge Deborah Knott series, but the Harald novels, starring a character every bit as complex as Knott, are equally entertaining. This one was originally published in paper in 1982 and has been reprinted occasionally, but it remains difficult to track down.

This former senior VP of CIGNA explained how health insurers make promises they have no intention of keeping, how they flout regulations designed to protect consumers, and how they skew political debate with multibillion-dollar PR campaigns designed to spread disinformation.</p><p>Potter had walked away from a six-figure salary and two decades as an insurance executive because he could no longer abide the routine practices of an industry where the needs of sick and suffering Americans take a backseat to the bottom line. The last straw: when he visited a rural health clinic and saw hundreds of people standing in line in the rain to receive treatment in stalls built for livestock.</p><p>In <i>Deadly Spin</i>, Potter takes readers behind the scenes to show how a huge chunk of our absurd healthcare spending actually bankrolls a propaganda campaign and lobbying effort focused on protecting one thing: profits. Whatever the fate of the current health care legislation, it makes no attempt to change that fundamental problem. <br>Potter shows how relentless PR assaults play an insidious role in our political process anywhere that corporate profits are at stake-from climate change to defense policy. <i>Deadly Spin</i> tells us why-and how-we must fight back.</p></p><p><p><b>Wendell Potter </b>is a Senior Fellow on Health Care for the Center for Media and Democracy. In 2009, he retired after a twenty-year career as a PR executive for health insurers to speak out on both the need for health care reform and the increasingly unchecked influence of corporate PR. He is a native of Tennessee.</p><p>&#x201c;Potter engagingly weaves together industry secrets with his own moral struggle and transformation into a whistleblower who tried to beat back the spin that nearly killed Obamacare.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Emily Loftis, Mother Jones</i></p><p>&#x201c;May be the ideal whistleblower.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Time</i></p><p>&#x201c;As one former insurance executive testified before Congress, insurance companies are not only encouraged to find reasons to drop the seriously ill; they are rewarded for it. All of this is in service of meeting what [Potter] called &#x2018;Wall Street's relentless profit expectations.'&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>President Barack Obama, quoting Potter before Congress in September 2009</i></p><p>&#x201c;Wendell Potter is a straight shooter--and he hits the bulls-eye here with an expose of corporate power that reveals why real health care reform didn't happen, can't happen, and won't happen until that power is contained.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Bill Moyers</i></p><p>&#x201c;The recently passed health care bill did many good things, including make health insurance available to more Americans and restrain some of the most egregious practices of the health insurance industry. It also forced more people to become customers of that industry. What the bill did <i>not</i> do is reform the health care system. Wendell Potter explains why not, and what went wrong.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Howard Dean</i></p><p>&#x201c;Wendell Potter transformed the national debate over health care when he stood up and told the truth about the health insurance industry.By breaking the insurance industry's code of silence and explaining to his fellow Americans how health insurance companies put profits ahead of patient care, Wendell showed extraordinary courage. The compelling story of Wendell's conversion from a health care executive to an outspoken reform advocate is essential reading for anyone trying to understand the American health care system.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Senator Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia</i></p><p>&#x201c;<i>Deadly Spin</i> makes clear what reporters were--and are--up against as they try, and often fail, to make the complex pros and cons of health care reform clear to citizens, as big-money players misdirect and obfuscate. More important, it illuminates what citizens are upagainst as they try to figure it out.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Mike Hoyt, Executive Editor, Columbia Journalism Review</i></p><p>&#x201c;You're the Daniel Ellsberg of corporate America. I mean, what that man did during Vietnam helped to end that war . . . People should read this book. The whole book lays it right out there about how the health insurance companies had bamboozled this country and lied, just outright liedabout things.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Michael Moore to Wendell Potter on Countdown with Keith Olbermann</i></p><p>&#x201c;To get the country back on track, Potter exhorts consumers to adopt a healthy dose of skepticism toward corporate doublespeak. That's a sound prescription, one which no American can afford not to have filled.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Joshua Kendall, The Boston Globe</i></p><p>&#x201c;A gripping indictment.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Kate Pickert, Time</i></p><p>&#x201c;<i>DEADLY SPIN</i>is a must-read for all who want to learn more about what [the health reform law] is and what it is not. It is a handbook for social change.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>John Presta,New York Journal of Books</i></p><p>&#x201c;The book's as dramatic and suspenseful as a good novel.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Linda Greene, The Bloomington Alternative</i></p><p>&#x201c;Potter's <i>Deadly Spin</i> is an eye-opening account of the backroom antics of industries that do harm. You won't look at issues the same way after you read this book. If you can understand how &#x2018;spin' works, you will be able to understand the money and tactics used to distort the truth. And we need to know the power propaganda has on us all.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Kari Burns, Chicago Life Magazine</i></p><p>&#x201c;The health insurance industry's worst nightmare.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Portfolio.com</i></p><p>&#x201c;Wendell Potter, former vice president of corporate communications with insurance giant CIGNA, now a fellow with the spin-busting Center for Media and Democracy, used media appearances and testimony before Congressional committees to expose the dark manipulations of fact that insurance firms use to preserve for-profit healthcare. Then he put it all on paper with a terrific book&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>The Nation</i></p><p>&#x201c;Eloquent . . . Despite the damning revelations throughout his book, Mr. Potter's indictments of the industry he once served are far from heavy-handed; instead, they are suffused with the kind of transcendent empathy one finds in those who have undergone profound personal transformations.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Dr. Pauline Chen, Well Blog, New York Times</i></p><p>&#x201c;An illuminating, up-to-the-minute testimonial sure to garner widespread attention and controversy.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i></p><p>&#x201c;[Potter] ridicules the notion that America's free-market system can provide actual health care within a for-profit structure . . . This whistle-blower perspective will heighten discussion and debate on the vital topic of health care in America.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Mary Whaley, Booklist</i></p><p>&#x201c;Trenchantly critiques the failure of America's for-profit health-insurance system: the underhanded methods insurers use to &#x2018;dump the sick'; the skyrocketing premiums and deductibles that put health care beyond the reach of millions; the obscene salaries executives rake in while denying benefits to patients. These criticisms aren't new, but Potter's street cred and deep knowledge of the industry make his indictment unusually vivid and compelling.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p></p><h2>The Kingfisher Book of Children&#39;s Poetry</h2><p>An anthology of 250 items which include ballads, limericks, riddles, boasts, nonsense verse and a wide range of other poetry from Britain and overseas.

He died a free man in Spring Hill, Florida, at the age of seventy-nine.</p>Irishtown Made Me<br>I was born on June 30, 1901, on the corner of Nassau and Gold in a section along the Brooklyn docks known as Irishtown. When I was three, we moved over one block to High Street, between Gold Street and Bridge Street, and about five years later we moved down the block from 183 High to 227 High. Irishtown was wedged in between the East River on the north, the Navy Yard on the east, and the Washington Street entrance approach to the Brooklyn Bridge off to the west. To pin my own neighborhood down more closely, the Manhattan Bridge was built while I was nine or ten and we kids used to drive everybody crazy by clambering up the structural ironwork which was going up only a block away from my house.<br><br>It was a workingman's neighborhood of one- and two-family dwellings and small neighborhood stores in which credit was extended from payday to payday. We weren't bad off, considering. My father, William Francis Sutton, Sr.--I'm William Francis, Jr.--was a hard-working blacksmith who earned fifteen dollars a week, which was not a bad salary in those days. A blacksmith at that time was like an automobile mechanic today. No matter how bad the times got, there was always a place somewhere for a good one. My mother's father, who was totally blind, lived with us, and so did her brothers, John and Jim, plus John's wife, my Aunt Alice. My grandfather had gone blind from working over the coffee roasters for the A &amp; P stores, and he had a pension. The others all worked and contributed to the upkeep of the house. We were the first family in the neighborhood to have a Victrola, a brand-new Victor in which the music was produced from round cylinders and projected through a cone-shaped horn.<br><br>It was a tough neighborhood, but it was a toughness without any strut or swagger. There was constant warfare for control of the docks, because to control the docks meant that you controlled the gambling, the loan-sharking, the pilfering, and the kickbacks. Plus the loading racket, which was the sweetest racket of all. Two rackets really. A flat rate, otherwise known as extortion, was levied against the importer, and then another charge was levied against the truckers for every crate they loaded. Lead pipes and brass knuckles were standard equipment. Murder was commonplace. No one was ever convicted. A code of silence was observed in Irishtown more faithfully than omerts is observed by the Mafia.<br><br>A code of silence that was to have a powerful influence on my life.<br><br>Since it was all muscle, the gang members were generally in their late teens or early twenties and therefore very easy for a kid to identify with. The dock boss--the leader--would usually be a little older, all the way up into his mid-twenties, maybe. They gained control by killing their predecessors, and they in turn were killed by their successors. Two years was a long time for a dock boss to stay alive; the turnover was very rapid. They were beaten to a pulp on a dark street; they were shot or stabbed and dumped into the water.<br><br>Bill Lovert, my first idol, held power longer than most. A slim man, not very tall, with a sure sense of command and a vibrant personality. Or, at any rate, he was before he had his head bashed in along the docks one night. His successor, Dinny Meehan, was the only dock boss I can remember who died in bed. By which I mean that somebody slipped in through his bedroom window while he was asleep and put a bullet in his brain.<br><br>It wasn't only the gangs that were at war with the police. Everybody was. If a man was arrested, his whole family would run alongside the paddy wagon screaming:<br><br>"Stop beating my husband!"<br><br>"Stop beating my son!"<br><br>"They're murdering my daddy!"<br><br>The word would go out and in a matter of minutes all his friends would gather outside the police headquarters at Poplar Street and set up a clamor:<br><br>"Murderers! Cowards! Leave the lad alone!"<br><br>The lad was going to be beaten up anyway. Everybody knew that. The theory was that if you could show the police that there were people on the outside who were interested in his welfare the beating would be less severe.<br><br>Either way, all the police ever got out of him was the exercise. Nobody ever talked in Irishtown.<br><br>The Italian section began on the other side of the Tillary Street Slaughterhouse, and as far as the kids were concerned we got along very nicely. Probably, now that I think of it, because PS 5 was situated right on the border, and neither group had to fight its way through. The Irish mobs and the Italian mobs were something else. The Irish, having got there first, ran the docks, and the Italians were always fighting for their piece of the action. They didn't get very far. Scarface Al Capone was a member of the Italian mob, and it was common knowledge in later years that he had gone to Chicago because the Irish mob played too rough. Although there was one occasion I distinctly remember where the Irish mob invaded an Italian social club down at Union Street and Fourth Avenue in South Brooklyn, and several of the Irish were brought back dead.<br>If the docks were a battleground, the East River was both our playground and our lifeline. We swam through the raw untreated garbage which was dumped regularly into the river. We dove off the cargo barges as they were being pulled toward shore, against the tide, by their little tugboats. Before I was out of my early teens I was swimming to Manhattan and back with such ease that on three separate occasions I was able to rescue friends of mine who couldn't make it. If I hadn't been such a powerful swimmer in my youth I would never have been able to save myself, years later, when an attempt to escape from a Pennsylvania prison through the main sewer went all wrong.<br><br>Everything came in by barge, including the livestock that was headed for the Tillary Street Slaughterhouse. A cattle drive through the narrow cobblestone streets of Irishtown? I saw it often. The barges, carrying cattle or sheep, would dock a couple of blocks from St. Ann's, the first school I attended. The cattle would be driven down Hudson Avenue, past the tenement houses and the neighborhood stores, to the slaughterhouse, which was actually on Hudson Avenue, a little east of Tillary, a block away from PS 5, the second school I attended. The sheep didn't have to be driven. They would follow the Judas sheep, which, at this slaughterhouse anyway, was literally a black sheep. Two big iron doors would swing open and the sheep, baaing piteously, would be crowded into the building.<br><br>The slaughtering was done in open view on what could be compared to the loading platform of a factory. And it was slaughter on an assembly line. One of the workers would hit the cattle on the head with a sledgehammer to knock him off his feet and stun him and another would immediately slit his throat. With the sheep, they would simply run a long knife through the throat. The workers would be standing there in hip boots on a floor that was awash with blood, and every now and then one of them would stop to scoop up a cupful of the warm blood and drink it down. They were big, powerful men, and they believed that it gave them extra strength. That's what they told me, anyway. A couple of times while I was standing there watching, they even offered me a cup. I didn't like the taste of it much, but since I was never a kid to turn down a challenge I'd drink it.<br><br>I had nothing against the workers. They were German immigrants, most of them, with heavy accents. A job was a job. But that Judas sheep, I came to hate it. I swear that he knew what he was doing. There was an expression of exaggerated innocence on its face that no other sheep had. I hated it so much that I got all of my friends together and planned to drown it when the next load of sheep arrived. After the gangplank of the barge had been lowered we came running forward, swinging sticks and throwing rocks, and drove the black sheep right into the river. It had never occurred to any of us that the other sheep were going to follow it right into the river. What a mess!<br><br>I have never forgotten the Judas sheep, though. Or ever stopped hating it. How could I? I kept seeing that same expression of exaggerated innocence in the faces of the hired killers, the woman stranglers, and the sex fiends I ran across in prison.<br>We were not a family that ever had any trouble with the police. Nobody before me. And nobody except me. My mother was a deeply religious woman who filled the house with religious paintings and artifacts and was always stuffing rosary beads and religious medals into my pockets. We were regular churchgoers, and my brother, Jimmy, who was 15 months older than me, and my sister Helen remained very active in religious affairs all of their lives.<br><br>Over all of us hung the memory of the family tragedy, the death of my little sister Agnes. Agnes had been one year younger than me, a beautiful little girl with a headful of curls, the darling of the family. Such an outstanding little beauty that people were always commenting on it. When she was seven years old, she fell off the stoop in front of the house, split the back of her head open, and contracted meningitis.<br><br>Two or three days, that's all it took. She died there in the house. In those days in that neighborhood, our people didn't trust the hospitals. Any more than they trusted anything else that smacked of officialdom. People went into the hospital and died, that's all they knew. "The Bellevue Disease," they would say with a shudder. And then cross themselves. "The Black Bottle," they'd whisper knowingly. For it was common gossip in my neighborhood that if they happened to need a bed or something at Bellevue, they would pick out a poor Irish patient and give him the Black Bottle. Poison.<br><br>Not that it would have mattered in Agnes's case. The doctors knew almost nothing about meningitis in those days, except that it was so highly contagious that the law required that the body be placed in a sealed coffin, lined with l...</p><h2>Adventure Time: The Enchiridion &amp; Marcy's Super Secret Scrapbook!!!</h2><p>It&#x2019;s <i>Adventure Time</i>&#x2122;!

The Road from Careggi </b> <p> <i>"[I]t is necessary now for you to be a man and not a boy; be so in words, deeds and manners."</i> </p><p> -- <b>Piero de' Medici to Lorenzo, May 11, 1465</b> </p><p> Late on the morning of August 27, 1466, a small group of horsemen left the Medici villa at Careggi and turned onto the road to Florence. It was a journey of three miles from the villa to the city walls along a meandering path that descended through the hills that rise above Florence to the north. Dark cypresses and hedges of fragrant laurel lined the road, providing welcome shade in the summer heat. Through the trees the riders could catch from time to time a glimpse of the Arno River flashing silver in the sun. </p><p> On any other day this would have been a relaxing journey of an hour or so, the heavy August air encouraging a leisurely pace, the beauties of the Tuscan countryside inspiring laughter and conversation among the young men. "There is in my opinion no region more sweet or pleasing in Italy or in any other part of Europe than that wherein Florence is placed," wrote a Venetian visitor, "for Florence is situated in a plain surrounded on all sides by hills and mountains.... And the hills are fertile, cultivated, pleasant, all bearing beautiful and sumptuous palaces built at great expense and boasting all manner of fine features: gardens, woods, fountains, fish ponds, pools and much else besides, with views that resemble paintings." </p><p> But today, the mood was somber. The men peered nervously from side to side, fingering the pommels of their swords. Gnarled olive trees, ancient and silver-leaved, hugged terraces cut into the slopes, and parallel rows of vines glistening with purple grapes gave the hills a tidy geometry worthy of a fresco by Fra Angelico. </p><p> Taking the lead was a young man who rode with the easy grace of a born horseman. His appearance was distinctive, though not at first glance particularly attractive. Above an athletic frame, bony and long-limbed, was a rough-hewn face. His nose, which was flattened and turned to the side as if it had once been broken, gave him something of the look of a street brawler, and the prominent jaw that caused his lower lip to jut out pugnaciously did nothing to soften this impression. Beneath heavy brows peered black, piercing eyes more suggestive of animal cunning than refined intelligence. Dark hair, parted in the middle, hung down to his shoulders, providing a stern frame to the irregular features. Even a close friend, Niccol� Valori, was forced to admit that "nature had been a step-mother to him with regard to his personal appearance. [N]onetheless," continued Valori, "when it came to the inner man she truly acted as a kindly mother.... [A]lthough his face was not handsome it was full of such dignity as to command respect."* </p><p> This homely face belonged to Lorenzo, the seventeen-year-old son and heir of Piero de' Medici. Since the death of Lorenzo's grandfather Cosimo, two years earlier, Piero had taken over the far-flung Medici banking empire, a position that made him one of the richest men in Europe. But it was not wealth alone that made the Medici name famous throughout Europe. The Medici, though they possessed no titles, were regarded by those unfamiliar with the intricacies of local politics as kings in all but name of the independent Florentine Republic, which, though small compared with the great states of Europe, dazzled the civilized world through the brilliance of her art and the vitality of her intellectual life. Not many generations removed from their peasant origins, the Medici spent lavishly on beautifying their city in the expectation that at least some of its glamour would rub off on its first family. </p><p> It was Cosimo who had parlayed his apparently inexhaustible fortune into a position of unprecedented authority in the state. On his tombstone in the family church of San Lorenzo were the words <i>Pater Patriae</i> ("Father of His Country"), bestowed on him by a grateful public for his wise stewardship and generous patronage of the city's civic and religious institutions. Cosimo had dominated the councils of government through the force of his personality and his willingness to open his own coffers when the state was short of cash. Florentines, like modern-day Americans, had a healthy respect for money and seemed to feel that those who showed a talent for amassing it must possess other, less visible virtues. Cosimo rarely held high political office, happy to let others enjoy the pomp of life in the <i>Palazzo della Signoria</i> as long as important decisions were left in his hands.* For a time the gratitude Florentines felt toward Cosimo earned for his son Piero the allegiance of a majority of the citizens, and, until recent troubles, it had been generally assumed that this crucial position as the leading figure in the <i>reggimento</i> -- the regime that really ran Florence, whoever temporarily occupied the government palace -- would one day pass to the young man now guiding his small band along the road to Florence. </p><p> On this August morning, however, the fate of the Medici and their government seemed to teeter on a knife's edge. The ancient constitution of the republic, in which the governing of the state had been shared widely among the city's wealthy and middle-class citizens, had been undermined by this single family's rise to prominence. The heavy-handed tactics they used to win and to wield power had stirred up resentment as once proud families saw themselves reduced to little more than servants of the Medici court. </p><p> But now a group of rich and influential men saw an opportunity to strike back. The various factions that normally made Florentine politics a lively affair had been secretly arming themselves for months. Rumors of foreign armies on the march -- a different one for each side in the contest -- increased the general paranoia until it seemed as if the smallest incident might touch off a general conflagration. </p><p> On one side were the Medici loyalists, the Party of the Plain (named for the site of the Medici palace on low-lying land on the north bank of the Arno), who favored the current system, which they claimed had brought decades of peace and prosperity. On the other was the Party of the Hill, centered on Luca Pitti's palace on the high ground to the south, who pointed out that Medici ascendance had been purchased at the expense of the people's traditional liberty. The most visible figures in the rebellion were former members of Cosimo's inner circle whose democratic zeal, not much in evidence in recent years, was rekindled by the humiliating prospect of having to take orders from his son. Few of them, in fact, had sterling reformist credentials. Most had connived with Cosimo in his systematic undermining of republican institutions, but now they adopted as their own the slogan "<i>Popolo e Libert�!</i>" (the "People and Liberty!"). </p><p> Discontent with the despotic tendencies of the government was not the only factor precipitating the current crisis. The perceived weakness of the fifty-year-old Piero contributed to a general sense that the regime was not only corrupt but, perhaps even worse, adrift. Even before Cosimo's death in 1464 the influential Agnolo Acciaiuoli, now one of the leaders of the Hill, complained that Cosimo and Piero had become "cold men, whom illness and old age have reduced to such cowardice that they avoid anything that might cause them trouble or worry." The citizens of Florence, said the uncharitable Niccol� Machiavelli some years later, "did not have much confidence in [Cosimo's] son Piero, for notwithstanding that he was a good man, nonetheless, they judged that...he was too infirm and new in the state." </p><p> Even many of Piero's supporters shared that gloomy assessment. From his youth, Piero (known to history as <i>il Gottoso</i>, the Gouty) had been plagued by the family ailment that rendered him for long periods a virtual prisoner in his own house. It was a disease that affected not only his body but his temper. The architect Filarete wrote in his biographical sketch of the Medici leader, "those who have [gout] are usually rather acid and sharp in their manner," but that while "few can bear its pains...[Piero] bears it with all the patience he can." Piero also lacked his father's common touch, the earthy humor that endeared Cosimo to the city's humbler elements. (Once when a petitioner, hoping to reform the sagging morals of the city, begged Cosimo to pass a law prohibiting priests from gambling, the practical Cosimo replied, "First stop them from using loaded dice." ) Piero, by contrast, was an aesthete and connoisseur who liked nothing better than to retire to his study, where he could gaze at his fine collection of antique busts, ancient manuscripts, and rare gemstones. </p><p> Citizens complained that policy was hatched in the privacy of the Medici palace on the Via Larga, rather than in open debate at the Palace of the Priors, as the sickly Piero was often forced to meet with his trusted lieutenants over dinner in his house or in his bedchamber. Such a reserved and quiet man was unlikely to appeal to the pragmatic merchants of Florence, who approached politics in much the same lively spirit as they entered the city's marketplaces, eager to buy and sell, to argue and cajole, to win an advantage if possible but in any case to strike deals and shake hands at the conclusion of a bargain hard driven but mutually beneficial. In both the Palace of the Priors and in the <i>Mercato Vecchio</i> (the Old Market in the heart of the city), relations of trust built on face-to-face encounters were more important than abstract ideology. Piero was an intensely private man in a world that valued above all the lively give-and-take of the street corner. </p><p> The best contemporary portrait of Piero is the fine marble bust by Mino da Fiesole.* The sculpture reveals a handsome man with the cropped hair of an ancient Roman patrician and alert, thoughtful eyes. But there is something in the pugnacious thrust of his chin, a feature passed down to his oldest son, that suggests an inner strength hi...</p></p><h2>Mah Jong, Anyone?</h2><p>Mah Jong, the ancient game of China, is enjoying another burst of popularity in America, as well as in Asia. Often seen as a mystery to Westerners, Mah Jong includes the combination of skill, chance and social interaction of Western games like dominoes, bridge and dice.<br><br>Authors Strauser and Evans unlock this mystery with an easy-to-follow instructional book which outlines the rules and strategy of the game for Westerners. The perfect primer for the new player and a convenient manual for old hands, <i>Mah Jong, Anyone?</i> gives basic information on equipment, accessories, terminology, rules of play, scoring, penalties and bonuses. Experienced Mah Jong players will especially welcome the section on special hands.</p><p>Ask any player about the rules to mah jong and the inevitable answer is a frustrating, &#34;Well, that depends.&#34; The game has so many variations that the rules change according to city, country, and even year. But don&#39;t worry--this book provides a solution by presenting clear and simple rules that combine the ancient spirit of the game with some of the best modern innovations. Once you learn the basics here, it&#39;s much simpler to pick up local variants. Even old pros may find some new information on special hands to liven up their house rules.<b>Kitty Strauser</b> of Baltimore, MD and <b>Lucille Evans</b> of New York, NY traveled throughout America and Asia, following their husbands from one military assignment to another, for years.

Peter Richmond, co-author of the <em>New York Times </em>bestseller <em>The Glory Game</em>, offers a fascinating look at the 1970s Oakland Raiders, led by colorful greats from another era: Ken Stabler, Willie Brown, Gene Upshaw, Jim Otto, Art Shell, head coach John Madden, and owner Al Davis. In the bestselling vein of <em>Boys Will Be Boys</em>, <em>Badasses </em>chronicles the bar-room exploits, practice-field pranks, and Super Bowl glories of the team&#x2019;s many misfits, cast-offs, psychos, and geniuses of the game.<br></p><p><blockquote><p>They were the NFL's ultimate outlaws, black-clad iconoclasts who, with a peculiar mix of machismo and brotherhood, of postgrad degrees and firearms, merrily defied pro football corporatism. </p></blockquote><p>The Oakland Raiders of the 1970s were some of the most outrageous, beloved, and violent football teams ever to play the game. In this rollicking biography, Peter Richmond tells the story of Oakland's wrecking crew of castoffs, psychos, oddballs, and geniuses who won six division titles and a Super Bowl championship under the brilliant leadership of coach John Madden and eccentric owner Al Davis.</p><p>Richmond goes inside the locker room and onto the field with Ken Stabler, Willie Brown, Fred Biletnikoff, George Atkinson, Phil Villapiano, and the rest of this band of brothers who made the Raiders legendary. He vividly recounts days of grueling practices and hell-raising nights of tavern crawling&#x2014;from smoking pot and hiring strippers during training camp to sharing game-day beers with their hardcore fans (including the Bay Area's other badasses, the Black Panthers and the Hells Angels). Richmond reveals a group of men who, after years of coming up short in the AFC Championship game, saw their off-kilter loyalty to the black and silver finally pay off with their emphatic Super Bowl victory in 1977. Funny, raunchy, and inspiring, Badasses celebrates the '70s Raiders as the last team to play professional football the way it was meant to be played: down and very dirty.</p><p>Peter Richmond is the author of four other books, including <em>The Glory Game</em> (with Frank Gifford). His writing has appeared in <em>The New Yorker</em>, <em>Vanity Fair</em>, <em>Rolling Stone</em>, the <em>New York Times Magazine</em>, and <em>GQ</em>. He lives with his wife in Dutchess County, New York.</p></p><h2>Glamorama</h2><p>We'll slide down the surface of things . . .<br><br>From his first novel--<b>Less Than Zero</b>, published when he was still a college student--to his most recent--the fierce <b>American Psycho</b>Bret Easton Ellis has been a powerful and original presence in contemporary literature, whether giving voice to a previously inchoate generation or provoking a controversy that raged throughout the culture.<br><br> Now he takes a quantum leap forward: an awesome reckoning of the American Century at endgame. In <b>Glamorama</b>, a young man in what is recognizably fashion- and celebrity-obsessed Manhattan is gradually, imperceptibly drawn into a shadowy looking-glass of that society, there and in London and Paris, and then finds himself trapped on the other side, <br>in a much darker place where fame and terrorism and family and politics are inextricably linked and sometimes indistinguishable. At once implicated and horror-stricken, his ways of escape blocked at every turn, he ultimately discovers--back on the other, familiar side--that there was no mirror, no escape, no world but this one in which hotels implode and planes fall from the sky.<br><br> Time and again, the novel confounds one's expectations of it, and Bret Ellis accomplishes the transitions from comic to surreal to horrific to humane with astonishing confidence. Matching ambition with artistic maturity, <b>Glamorama</b> is at once hilarious, savage in its worldly observation, and compassionate in its vision: a defining novel of our times.</p><p><i>Glamorama</i> is a satirical mass-murder opus more ambitious than Bret Easton Ellis's 1990 <i>American Psycho</i>. It starts as a spritz-of-consciousness romp about kid-club entrepreneur Victor Ward, "the It boy of the moment," an actor-model up for <i>Flatliners II</i>. Ellis has perfect pitch for glam-speak, and he gives nightlife the fizz, pace, and shimmer it lacks in drab reality. Anyone could cite the right celeb names and tunes, but like a rock-polishing machine, his prose gives literary sheen to fame-chasing air-kissers. He's coldly funny: when Victor's girl tries to argue him out of a breakup, she angrily snorts six bumps of coke, stops, mutters, "Wrong vial," snorts four corrective doses from whatever she has in her other fist, then objects to a rival at the party wearing the same dress she's wearing.<p> You had to be there; Ellis makes you feel you are. But such satire is a very smart bomb targeting a very large barn. Models' status anxiety doesn't merit Ellis's Tom Wolfe-esque expertise. <i>Glamorama</i> gets better when Victor gets drafted into a mysterious group of model-terrorists who bomb 747s and the Ritz in Paris, wearing Kevlar-lined Armani suits. Oh, they still behave like shallow snobs, pronouncing "cool" as if it had 12 o's. But now when somebody swills Cristal, it's apt to be poisoned, to horrific effect, which Ellis expertly, affectlessly describes. His enfant-terrible debut, <i>Less Than Zero</i>, aped Joan Didion. Now Ellis has grown into a lesser Don DeLillo--and that's high praise. <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p>"His best work to date...He remains a laser-precise satirist, but the wit now dominates."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>--Matt Seaton, <i>Esquire</i> <br><br>"Gets under the skin of our celebrity culture in a way that is both illuminating &amp; frightening"<br>--Michael Shelden, <i>Daily Telegraph</i>, London<br><br>"One of the passing delights of Glamorama is to imagine how scholars of postmodern fiction <br>will explain it a century hence...Ellis invents a fresh hell on every page...[And] through all this mayhem the style remains mysteriously elegant"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>--Alex Ross, <i>The New Yorker</i><br><br>"An affirmation inside a horror story...A big collection of paradoxes: of truth and lies, of beauty and fear, of principle and depravity...A master stylist with hideously interesting new-fangled manners and the heart of an old-fashioned moralist."<br>--Andrew Morton, <i>The Observer</i>, London<br><br>"A comic and frightening story...A plotline that arcs and undulates...The pleasures of a celebrity-worshipping narrative overlaying a violent, chilling and, in the style of Ballard, instructive plot"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>--Adam Mazmanian, <i>Newsday</i><br><br>"An express-train ride,in my mind, to hell...It does for the cold, minimal 90's what <i>American<br>Psycho</i> did for the Wall Street greed of the 80's.

Alice Hoffman is an author not to be missed.&#x201d;--<i>Historical Novels Review<br><br></i>"Alice Hoffman, herself a shining star among American novelists, possesses the stunning ability to express the numinous in the most prosaic language. Somehow, without elaborate wordplay, she manages to communicate a yearning interpretation of the life we all live, opening the reader&#x2019;s eyes to the otherworldly riddles that make things appear just a trifle askew&#x2014;when we notice them, that is.

And if that's not enough to turn his life upside down, the reappearance of his first serious girlfriend is. The basketball star turned sports agent, who does a little detecting when business is slow, is saddened by the news that Emily Downing's 13-year-old son is dying and desperately needs a bone marrow transplant; even if she did leave him for the man who destroyed his basketball career, he wouldn't wish tsuris like that on anyone. And he's not at all interested in getting involved with Emily again, not even to track down the one mysterious donor who may be able to save the boy. But when Myron learns that Jeremy Downing is his <i>own</i> son, conceived the night before Emily and Greg Downing married, he embarks on a search for someone who disappeared a lifetime ago. And what he finds leads him to a powerful family determined to keep an old secret, a disgraced reporter who may have plagiarized a novel to create a serial killer, a very interested FBI agent, and a missing child. <p> This is the seventh outing in a series that's been gaining in popularity since Bolitar's first appearance, in Harlan Coben's <i>Deal Breaker</i>. Myron's a bit of a baby, but he's not afraid to get rough when the situation calls for it, he's eminently likable, and his heart's in the right place. The fireworks are supplied by his friend and partner, Win, who really deserves a series of his own, and Esperanza, the lesbian wrestler-lawyer who has finally talked Myron into making her a partner in the business. Like Coben's other Bolitar novels, she's worth every penny. <i>--Jane Adams</i></p>6 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>A Prepper&#39;s Herbal Apothecary</h2><p>A beginners guide to Naturopathic treatments when no doctor is available.

An adolescent girl's obsessive fear of being looked at. The "giddying sense of compassion" that a blind man introduces into a young housewife's settled existence. Of such is made the world of Clarice Lispector, the Brazilian writer whose finest work is acknowledged to be her exquisitely crafted short stories. Here, in these thirteen of Lispector's most brilliantly conceived stories, mysterious and unexpected moments of crisis propel characters to self-discovery or keenly felt intuitions about the human condition. Her characters mirror states of mind. Alienated by their unsettling sense of life's absurdity, they seem at times absorbed in their interior lives and in the passions that dominate and usually defeat them.</p></p><p>Text: English, Portugese (translation)"Reading Clarice Lispector's novels is like listening to a stranger unravel her thoughts and then walk out of the door, leaving behind a strong sense of character but few facts about daily life.

Austin Ball's rental car, the car he'd used to get here, was just a few feet away. Lance wouldn't look at the body, rolled up in the rug behind him, which he intended to bury, or think about the fact that his great-great-great-grandmother had saved that very rug from the Yankees during the War of Northern Aggression. What he'd done, he couldn't take back, which was a metaphor for his life.

He couldn't be known as the Morgan who'd squandered the family estate.<br><br>At first he'd had no trouble meeting his payments, and then weather and bad crop prices had combined, and he'd started falling behind on payments.

Any fool worth his salt would have known not to wear wool in Louisiana during the month of September.<br><br>It wasn't until after the meal that Ball had announced Martinelli's intentions to foreclose and produced papers to that effect, instead of the ones Lance had expected.<br><br>Lance's disbelief had been palpable. Heart-thumping. Hand-sweating. Gut-wrenching. He'd presented a logical solution: more time. It had been rejected, with the failing economy as an excuse. That was when Lance begged. When that failed, he lost his mind.<br><br>The moment Ball turned his back to pick up his briefcase, Lance grabbed a baseball bat that had been hanging on the library wall since his high school days and hit the lawyer in the back of the head with the same fervor as when he'd hit the ball over the fence and sealed the county championship during his senior year of high school. That swing had ended the game. This one ended Ball's life. Austin Ball dropped without uttering a sound. Even though he was down, and very obviously dead, Lance continued to swing. By the time he got himself together, nearly every bone in Ball's body was broken, and blood was everywhere.<br><br>That was when panic hit.<br><br>He dropped the bat beside the body, rolled them up together into the rug on which Ball had dropped and dragged it out of the house and into the rental car Ball had driven out to his property.<br><br>Still in a state of hysteria, and fearing someone would drive up at any minute and catch him in such a bloody mess, he ran back inside and began cleaning up all the blood splatter. With one eye on the clock, he tore off all his clothing and threw it into the washing machine, then raced through the house to his bedroom naked and dressed again. Minutes later he was in the rental car, driving on a narrow, single-lane road that led into the woods behind the family home. He needed to hide the body, and though he'd never dug anything deeper than a hole to plant flower bulbs, he was about to dig his first grave.<br><br>Now here he was, almost an hour later, battling panic and regret. The palms of his hands were burning. He would definitely have blisters. His back was aching, and his heart was pounding so hard he feared he might have a heart attack and die in the grave he was digging for Austin Ball.<br><br>As a gust of wind swirled the loose leaves into an eddy, then sent them flying across the forest floor toward where he was digging, he glanced up at the sky. A storm predicted earlier in the day was almost upon him.<br><br>"Son of a bitch," he muttered, and dug a little harder.<br><br>It was getting darker. The hurricane in the Gulf was going to miss them, but it had obviously stirred up some rough weather. He had to get Ball's body buried before it started to rain or, with Louisiana's loamy soil and an elevation barely above sea level, the damn thing was likely to float out. He jabbed the point of the shovel back into the earth. Just as he was about to throw out another scoop, he heard what sounded like a gasp, then a scream. The sound was so unexpected that he nearly died on the spot. He pivoted in panic, then stared in disbelief.<br><br>The hair rose on the back of Carolina North's neck as she rubbed her finger and thumb together, smearing the droplet that she'd found on the leaves of the forest floor. Her morning walk had just taken a startling turn.<br><br>It was blood!<br><br>She'd been seeing the small red spots for some time but thought them nothing more than autumn's natural colors. Now the bright red hue had taken on a more sinister meaning.<br><br>The next question had to be, was it animal or human?<br><br>At twenty-nine and a successful author, the mystery writer in her wanted to know the answer, and the only way she would find out was to follow the trail. She glanced up at the gathering clouds. From the look of the sky, they were in for some bad weather. The side winds from a hurricane were forecast to brush the Louisiana coast sometime today, although the brunt of the storm was predicted to go farther south and west, and hit Galveston, Texas. She was sorry for Galveston, but sincerely happy this one was going to miss them. Still, all kinds of storms could erupt from such turbulent weather. The smart thing to do would be to turn around and head for home before she got soaked, but her conscience wouldn't let her. It could be something as innocent as a hiker like herself who'd been injured and was now wandering the Louisiana woods and bayous in search of help. What kind of a person would she be if she ignored the possibility of helping someone?<br><br>She paused long enough to get her bearings, although she wasn't far from the home she shared with her aging parents. If she walked up on an injured animal, which could prove dangerous, she needed to know which way to run to safety.<br><br>With a touch of anxiety, Cari moved forward, although the wind from the storm front was getting stronger and the blood trail was almost gone. She was on the verge of turning around and making a run for home when she stumbled into a small clearing. It was a familiar place&#x2014;a clearing in which she had played countless times as a child.<br><br>At first, all she saw was an unfamiliar black car. Then she took a couple of steps to the right and realized there was a man standing in a very deep hole and shoveling out dirt. Within seconds she recognized Lance. He was someone she'd grown up with&#x2014;a man she'd once been engaged to until she'd caught him in bed with a stripper from Baton Rouge. She watched for a moment, noticing the frantic manner in which he was digging.<br><br>What on earth...?<br><br>Before she could call out and announce her presence, the wind gusted sharply, blowing back the corner of what she'd first taken to be a pile of rags. When she saw the face and shoulder of a man's bloody body suddenly revealed, she realized she'd found the source of the blood.<br><br>And then it hit her.<br><br>The man was dead. And the hole Lance was digging was a grave.<br><br>Before she thought, she screamed, and for a few, life-altering seconds, Cari had an out-of-body experience as she found herself staring into the eyes of a killer. That it was Lance Morgan, her closest neighbor and childhood friend, seemed impossible.<br><br>She heard him shout out her name, and when he started to climb out of the hole, instinct told her to run.<br><br>So she did.<br><br>Within the space of a heartbeat, she was gone&#x2014;running toward home as fast as she could go, without looking back. The wind was at her heels now, pushing at her, urging her faster and faster. Leaves were being torn from the trees and swirling around her head in a blizzard of reds and yellows. The wind was rattling the limbs overhead so sharply she kept thinking she was being shot at. Once she stumbled and fell to her knees, but she quickly caught herself and sprang up. With one frantic look over her shoulder to make sure Lance wasn't on her heels, she bolted.<br><br>Desperate to notify the authorities before Lance caught her, she pulled out her cell phone as she ran, intent on calling 911, but she couldn't get a signal. Blaming the lowlands and the oncoming storm, she kept on running, praying for a miracle.<br><br>With each passing second, she imagined she could hear Lance's footsteps coming up behind her and feared that&#x2014;at any moment&#x2014;she would be caught and overpowered. When a strong gust of wind suddenly sent a dead limb flying from overhead to land on her heels, she pitched forward, certain that she'd been caught. Screaming and kicking, she rolled over on her back, unwilling to die without a fight, only to find herself doing battle with the limb, which had been caught in the hem of her jeans.<br><br>"God, help me," Cari muttered, and quickly kicked herself free.<br><br>She scrambled to her feet, desperate to get home, never thinking to check for her cell phone, which had slipped from her pocket as she fell.<br><br>Lance screamed Cari's name as he leaped out of the half-dug grave, then stumbled and fell over the body in the rug. Once again, Austin Ball had thrown a major kink in his plans. By the time he got up, Cari was out of sight. He dashed into the woods with the shovel in his hand, racing through the thickets and brambles without care or caution for his bare skin. He had to stop her. His life and Morgan's Reach depended on it. But it was with growing horror that he realized she had eluded him, and that she knew these woods as well as he did&#x2014;maybe better.<br><br>Now he was faced with a dilemma. She would get the parish police, of that he was certain. He only had one chance out of this mess and that was to deny everything she said. Which meant he couldn't bury Ball's body here now because she would certainly bring back the authorities to look for it.<br><br>Cursing at the top of his lungs, he began running back to where he'd been digging. The wind was tearing at his clothing as he dashed into the clearing. To his horror, the rug had completely blown away from around Ball's body, and the sight of the man lying flat on his back in the middle of a blood-soaked family heirloom was horrifying.<br><br>In a panic, he began filling in the hole he'd just dug. The rain would wash away any loose soil and pack the dirt back down, so even if Cari brought the authorities here and dug again, there wouldn't be anything to find.<br><br>The first drops of rain were beginning to fall as he threw in the last of the dirt, then propped the shovel against the black rental car. Now that the hole was refilled, he still had to do something with the body. With shaking hands, he rolled the rug back around Ball's corpse, then hefted it over his shoulder and grabbed the shovel. He needed to find another place to hide what he'd done, but that meant going deeper into the forest&#x2014;farther from his house&#x2014;closer to the bayous. He didn't have time to get to the swamplands and use the gators as a method of getting rid of the body. He had to bury it.<br><br>But if he went farther, the car was going to be of no use.<br><br>With a muttered curse, he gritted his teeth and headed deeper into the woods, walking with his head down, sometimes staggering against the dead weight of Austin Ball's body and the prevailing winds.<br><br>But where to hide it so Cari and the cops couldn't find it? Where could he dig another grave that wouldn't be found? The answer didn't come until he passed a familiar landmark&#x2014;an ancient cypress stump. His granddad used to tell stories of how the bayou had once come up this far, until they'd built levees and dikes around Bordelaise. The moment he saw the stump, he remembered what lay beyond. The fact that he suddenly had an answer to his problem made his load lighter and his steps easier.<br><br>Cari's legs were shaking from exertion and there was a pain in her side, but she couldn't stop. She had no way of knowing how close Lance was behind her, but she kept telling herself that it would all be okay as soon as she got home.<br><br></p><h2>Birds of Prey (Courtney Family Adventures)</h2><p><p>It is 1667 and the Dutch and the English are at war.

Possessed by the Dark Destiny, she had stolen Garion's infant son to use in a ritual that would destroy all that was fair and good.<br><br>Always the quest led onward, across and beyond the continent of Mallorea, where the Evil God Torak had once been supreme until Garion slew him. And always Zandramas was one step ahead of them. The armies she had raised, led by a Demon Lord, threatened to cut them off on one side: on the other, the forces of the Emperor Zakath were seeking to capture them.<br><br>Zandramas was taunting them and spying on them, flying over in the form of the great dragon, while the Dark Destiny changed her and etched away the last of her touches of humanity.<br><br>Somehow, as the Seeress of Kell had warned them, they had to be at the Place Which Is No More for the ritual at the same time as Zandramas, if they were to have a chance to defeat her evil schemes.<br><br>But where that might be they still had no clue.</p><p>David Eddings (1931-2009) published his first novel, High Hunt, in 1973, before turning to the field of fantasy with The Belgariad, soon followed by The Malloreon. Born in Spokane, Washington, and raised in the Puget Sound area north of Seattle, he received his Bachelor of Arts degree from Reed College in Portland, Oregon, in 1954, and a master of arts degree from the University of Washington in 1961. He served in the US Army, worked as a buyer for the Boeing Company, and was both a grocery clerk and a college English teacher. He lived in Nevada until his death, at the age of 77.In the battle between good and evil in the land of Mallorea begun in Guardians of the West , the wizard and shape-changer Belgarion continues his quest with 10 companions. They include his wife, Queen Ce'Nedra, his grandfather, Belgarath, and other members of his shape-changing wizard family, and the wily merchant Prince Kheldar, also known as Silk. The sorceress Zandramas, now Child of the Dark after the death of the god Torak at the hands of Belgarion (who is the Child of the Light) has stolen Belgarion's young son to use in a ritual prophesied to assure the dominance of the forces of the Dark. They find an original copy of the Ashabine Oracles, written long before Belgarion's birth, which contains a message to him from Torak that directs them to the ancient city of Kell. As they race other interested parties across battle-blasted landscapes, the group encounters warring troops of men and demons, and the Emperor of Mallorea, who joins the party on the orders of a blind seeress. Eddings depicts a complex, believable and colorful society filled with nobles, rogues and common people, the latter characters ringing particularly true, as does the world of the wolves into which Belgarion and his relatives change. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Mrs. Pollifax and the Lion Killer</h2><p>As millions of readers know, that intrepid charmer and part-time CIA agent Emily Pollifax is a joy, with a warm heart, nerves of steel, and manners as impeccable as her karate.

Under Sammat's selfless leadership it is recovering from the devastation wrought by two greedy presidents-for-life who preceded him in office. But Sammat has dangerous enemies. Everywhere rumors are springing up that he is a sorcerer and that his evil power is responsible for a rash of shocking murders in which the victims appear to have been clawed to death by a lion. These crimes are especially terrifying because there are no lions in Ubangiba.<br>Without the comforting backup of the CIA, Mrs. Pollifax wades into the fray, hunting for the source of the bloody terrorism that threatens Sammat and Ubangiba.

The first graphic novel in the series contains two enchanting novellas, "The Way Home" &amp; "The Bittersweet Summer," wherein Owly discovers the meaning of friendship, and that saying goodbye doesn't always mean forever.</p><p>In this charming series by mini-comics specialist Runton, Owly and Wormy carry out their dialogue-less but absorbing activities in classic best-friend fashion. They live together in a friendly forest reminiscent of the ones often found in children's literature, and much in the style of Frog and Toad, or Winnie the Pooh and Piglet, Owly and Wormy's smallest excursions and challenges are the stuff of great mystery and adventure. With nothing but significant looks and great lashings of expressive ink, Runton brings these gentle characters and their concerns vividly to life. In the story "The Way Home," we learn how Wormy, initially terrified of the bird of prey, moves from fear to trust when Owly saves his life and later convinces his skeptical worm parents that Owly is a valuable friend. In "The Bittersweet Summer," the pair befriends some hummingbirds who must leave them behind when it's time to fly south for the winter. In both tales, the plots are simple enough for children to grasp, yet the characterizations will draw in all but the most reluctant adults. Owly is mostly made up of a large, expressive pair of eyes, while Wormy is little more than a squiggle and a smile. They wear sun hats while gardening and scarves during winter. Though it doesn't sound like much, under Runton's pen, the whole is winningly lively. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.Gr. 3-5. In this nearly wordless bit of graphic fun, Runton tells two stories about wly the little owl. In "The Way Home," lonely Owly rescues Wormy from a thunderstorm, and, after nursing him back to health, helps him find his way home. "The Bittersweet Summer" tells a slightly more complicated story about friendship, as Owly and Wormy befriend two hummingbirds during the course of the spring and summer, and say goodbye to them when they migrate south for the winter. Owly is a delightfully sweet book. The whimsical black-and-white art is done with great facility for expressing emotion, and Runton's reliance on icons and pictures in lieu of the usual dialogue makes the story perfect for give-and-take between children and their parents; even readers older than the target audience will appreciate the book's simple charm, wisdom, and warmth. <i>Tina Coleman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

There is her lover, Callum Finella, a twenty-year-old Scottish prisoner of war who was brought from the stalag to her family&#x2019;s farm as forced labor. And there is a twenty-six-year-old Wehrmacht corporal, who the pair know as Manfred&#x2013;who is, in reality, Uri Singer, a Jew from Germany who managed to escape a train bound for Auschwitz.<br><br>As they work their way west, they encounter a countryside ravaged by war.

And, as the war had dragged on, the pool of marriage prospects&#x2014;in Anna&#x2019;s mind, often enough that meant merely her older brother Werner&#x2019;s acquaintances&#x2014;dried up completely. The soldiers were either missing or disfigured or dead.<br><br>But then came the POWs. Seven of them, sent from the prison camp to help with the harvest.<br><br>And a week after the POWs arrived at Kaminheim, when the corn was almost completely harvested and everyone was about to begin to gather the sugar beets and the apples, there came four naval officers in search of a plow. They were planning to mark a groove through the estate that would be the start of an antitank trench. When it was complete, the trench would span the length of the district, bisecting some farms, skirting the edges of others. Meanwhile, different officers were visiting neighboring estates as well, and the Emmerichs were told that at some point in the coming month hundreds of foreigners and old men would follow them, and descend on the estate to actually construct the trench.<br><br>And while the very idea of an antitank trench was alarming, the presence of all those handsome young men&#x2014;the Germans, the Brits, and that one very young Scot&#x2014;made it a burden Anna was willing to shoulder. This was true, at least in part, because she didn&#x2019;t honestly believe the fighting would ever come this far west. It couldn&#x2019;t. Even the naval officers said this was a mere precau- tion. And so she would flirt with the Brits during the day in the fields, where she would work, too, and dance with the naval officers in the evenings in the manor house&#x2019;s small but elegant ballroom. Mutti would play the piano, joined after that first night by Callum Finella on Uncle Felix&#x2019;s accordion, while her father&#x2014;though distracted by the news from the east&#x2014;would look on benignly. Sometimes Theo would put his toy cavalrymen away and watch as well, appalled in the manner of any ten-year-old boy that these brave and accomplished soldiers wanted to waste their time with the likes of his sister and her friends. He followed the men around like a puppy.<br><br>Helmut did, too. But Helmut actually would work with the officers as long as their father allowed him away from the har- vest, helping them to find their way around the endless acres of Kaminheim, and thus mark out the optimum design and place- ment of the trench. Then, after dinner, he would dance with Anna&#x2019;s friends&#x2014;girls who, previously, he had insisted were too puerile to be interesting. Seeing them now through the eyes of the navy men, however, he was suddenly discovering their charms.<br><br>Certainly Anna worried about her older brother, Werner, who had already been wounded once in this war and was fighting somewhere to the south. But she had rarely spent any time with men as interesting as this eclectic group who had descended upon their farm that autumn. She and Helmut had learned to speak English in school, though she had taken her studies far more seriously than her brother, which meant that she alone in the assemblage could speak easily to everybody&#x2014;the POWs during the day and the naval officers at night&#x2014;and appreciate how erudite and experienced everyone was. At least, she thought, in comparison to her. She was, on occasion, left almost dizzy as she swiveled among conversations and translated asides and remarks. And the longer stories? She felt like a star-struck child. When she was in grade school she had met English families the winter her family had gone skiing in Switzerland, but by 1944 she remembered little more than a very large man in a very poor bear costume, and the way she and the English children together had endured his clownish shenanigans because all of the parents had thought the fellow was wildly entertaining. But since the war had begun, she hadn&#x2019;t been west of Berlin. In the early years, they had still taken summer holidays on the beaches of the Baltic or ventured to Danzig for concerts, but lately even those trips had ceased completely. Two of their POWs, however, had seen the pyramids; another had been to America; and Callum&#x2014;the youngest of the group, the tallest of the group, and the only one from Scotland&#x2014;had been born in India, where his father had been a colonial official, and had traveled extensively throughout Bengali and Burma and Madras as a little boy.<br><br>Even the German naval officers were more interesting than any of the country boys&#x2014;or men&#x2014;she had met in her district. They, too, had seen places in Europe and Africa she&#x2019;d only read about in books.<br><br>Initially, she had worried that there might be unpleasant sparks when the Germans and the Brits crossed paths, especially on the first morning when the naval officers would be marking out a segment of the antitank trench in the very same beet fields where the POWs were working. But the two groups of men had largely ignored each other.<br><br>It was the next day, when she was working alongside the prisoners in the apple orchard, that one of the POWs&#x2014;that exuberant young giant named Callum&#x2014;segued from the usual flirtatious banter to which she had grown accustomed and had come to ex- pect from him, to guarded innuendos about Adolf Hitler and then (even more problematic, in some ways) to questions about the work camps.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re such a nice girl, Anna, and so sharp,&#x201d; he said, as the two of them stood together beside a particularly wiry tree, resting for a moment midmorning. There was a military policeman who must have been somebody&#x2019;s grandfather standing guard a hundred meters away, but he was so old he probably wouldn&#x2019;t have heard a word they were saying if they had been standing directly beside him. &#x201c;And your family is much more hospitable than necessary&#x2014;given the circumstances and all.&#x201d; The POWs were sleeping in the bunkhouse that the farmhands had used before they had either run off or been commandeered by the Reich for work in the mines and the munitions factories.<br><br>&#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; she said simply. She was unsure where this conversation was going, but that opening, that apparent surprise that she was such a nice girl, had her slightly wary. She&#x2019;d been laughing with Callum for days, and the thought crossed her mind that perhaps she had misjudged him. Grown too comfortable&#x2014;too friendly&#x2014;with him. With all the POWs.<br><br>&#x201c;So, I was wondering,&#x201d; he continued, his voice nonchalant. &#x201c;What do you think your Hitler is doing with the Jews?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;My Hitler? You make him sound like one of my horses,&#x201d; she said, aware that she was not answering his question.<br><br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t mean that. I meant . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What did you mean?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I had a mate in Scotland who was Jewish, a chum I played soccer with. We were friends, our parents were friends. He had family somewhere in Germany. And they just disappeared. There was talk of them trying to come to Edinburgh, but they couldn&#x2019;t get out. Eventually, the letters just dried up. Stopped coming. Then, at the stalag this summer, I met two chaps from Wales who had been in intelligence. And they said&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>She cut him off: &#x201c;At school, they told me not to ask when I inquired. They told me I didn&#x2019;t know what I was talking about.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But you asked?&#x201d;<br><br>Aware that she couldn&#x2019;t help but sound oversensitive, she answered, &#x201c;Maybe it would surprise you, but I do have a brain behind my eyes. Yes, I asked.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It wouldn&#x2019;t surprise me a bit,&#x201d; he said, smiling.<br><br>&#x201c;I asked them where the Jews were going,&#x201d; she continued. &#x201c;Before the war, my parents had friends in Danzig who were Jewish. That&#x2019;s where my father went to university: Danzig. He grew up on a farm in another part of Prussia, but for a time he considered becoming a lawyer. But he&#x2019;s a very scientific man. And he likes working the earth too much. Anyway, he has never understood the Nazis&#x2019; obsession with Jews. Never. My mother? It&#x2019;s different for her: She&#x2019;s lived her whole life here. She, too, thinks it&#x2019;s ridiculous, but she has always been a little oblivious of anything that doesn&#x2019;t involve the farm or this corner of the country.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re both party members, right?&#x201d;<br><br>She nodded. &#x201c;My father wouldn&#x2019;t have the contracts he has if he weren&#x2019;t a member of the party. Even I know that.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Tell me, then: These friends. Your parents&#x2019; Jewish friends. Where are they now?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;One, I know, was my father&#x2019;s banker. I don&#x2019;t know his name, but he took very good care of Father and Mutti on their honeymoon. The inflation was so horrible that suddenly they couldn&#x2019;t pay their bills and Father&#x2019;s stocks were worth nothing. Somehow, the banker solved everything for them and they had a perfectly lovely holiday after that.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What do you think became of him?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He and Father lost touch. But I can tell you this: My father wrote letters on his family&#x2019;s behalf to different people. I don&#x2019;t know who or what the letters were supposed to accomplish. But he wrote letters for other friends, too. And for a few weeks in the summer of 1940, my parents had some Jewish friends who lived with us: a younger couple and their baby. A little baby girl. She was adorable. They had lost their apartment in Danzig. I was thirteen and I always wanted to babysit, but the mother wouldn&#x2019;t let the child out of her sight.&#x201d; She could have gone on, but it was a memory she tried not to think about. There had been some talk about hiding the family&#x2014;and hiding was indeed the word her parents had used&#x2014;but so many people in the village had been aware of the Emmerichs&#x2019; visitors from Danzig that the couple had refused her mother and father&#x2019;s offer of sanctuary and simply disappeared into the fog one August morning.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m badgering you,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry. I didn&#x2019;t mean to. I have a habit of talking too much. You might have noticed.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re inquisitive,&#x201d; she said, unable to mask the small tremor she heard in her voice. The truth was, she didn&#x2019;t want to be having this conversation. She knew she wouldn&#x2019;t dare discuss these sorts of things on one of the streets in the village or in a city. One never knew who might be listening or how they might be connected to the party. And, suddenly, she felt an odd spike of defensiveness. &#x201c;But you tell me: How am I supposed to know where everyone is in the midst of a war?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well,&#x201d; he said evenly. &#x201c;You can keep track of the Jews because of the stars on their clothes. You&#x2019;ve seen them.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, of course I have. I&#x2019;ve seen them in Danzig and I&#x2019;ve seen them in Berlin.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Lately?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t been to Berlin lately. Or Danzig.&#x201d;<br><br>He used a handkerchief to wipe the perspiration away from his temples. The hair there was a bay that reminded her of Balga, her favorite horse. &#x201c;The folks who will be coming to build the antitank trench,&#x201d; he began, and she could tell that he was choosing his words with great care. &#x201c;You know, actually digging where those navy blokes are leaving the plow marks? They&#x2019;re the lucky ones.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;ll be more prisoners like you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Maybe. But I think they&#x2019;re going to come instead from those work camps. Not the prison camps. It will take hundreds of people just to dig through your farm. And, besides, it&#x2019;s one thing to put a group of us soldiers to work harvesting apples and corn and sugar beets. Trust me, this is luxurious compared to life in the stalag, and we are all deeply appreciative of your family&#x2019;s kindness. But it&#x2019;s quite another to make us dig antitank trenches. The Red Cross and the folks who penned the Geneva convention wouldn&#x2019;t exactly approve.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;So, the workers will be the criminals from the camps? Communists and Gypsies. Why should that trouble me?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And Jews. That&#x2019;s my point, Anna. They&#x2019;re in those camps for no other reason than because they&#x2019;re Jewish.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The Jews have been sent to the camps.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;No. That&#x2019;s not true.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, Anna. But it is.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The Jews have just been resettled,&#x201d; she continued, repeating what she had been told at school and at her meetings with other teen girls in the Bund Deutscher M�del whenever she had asked the question, but until that moment had never said aloud herself. Somehow, verbalizing the idea made it seem ludicrous. She certainly didn&#x2019;t add what so many of her teachers or BDM leaders had added over the years: They have to be resettled because they are not Aryan. They are inferior in every imaginable way, they are worse than the Russians and the Poles. Most have nothing that resembles an Aryan conscience, and they are interested in nothing but their money and mezuzahs and diamonds. Many are evil; all are conniving.<br><br>&#x201c;And doesn&#x2019;t even resettlement seem, I don&#x2019;t know, a trifle uncivilized&#x2014;even if it really is what&#x2019;s occurring?&#x201d; he went on. &#x201c;Think of that little family that was with you when you were thirteen. Why do you think there was talk of hiding them? I mean, suppose my government in England just decided to &#x2018;resettle&#x2019; the Catholics&#x2014;to take away their homes, their animals, their possessions, and then just send them away?&#x201d;<br><br>Another prisoner, the balding mason named Wally, passed by with one of the wicker baskets they used for the apples and gave Callum a look that Anna recognized instantly as the universal sign to shut up. His head was cocked slightly and his eyes were wide. Callum ignored him and continued, &#x201c;Those intelligence chaps from Wales. They told us about another camp. One further east in Poland. They had heard rumors&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve heard rumors. We&#x2019;ve all heard rumors. I&#x2019;ve listened to your propaganda on the radio.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You listen to the BBC? That&#x2019;s illegal, Anna, you know that,&#x201d; he told her, his voice mocking her good-naturedly.<br><br>&#x201c;Everyone listens. And you know that.&#x201d;<br><br>Wally dumped his apples in one of the shipping crates in the back of a wagon and started to say something, his mouth opening into an anxiety-ridden O, but then stopped himself and returned to the trees where he was working, shaking his head in bewilderment.<br><br>&#x201c;Besides,&#x201d; she said, angry now, &#x201c;what am I supposed to do? Am I supposed to go have tea with the f�hrer and advise him on policy?&#x201d; He paused, seeming to think about this, unsure what to say. She decided to press her advantage. &#x201c;You would be in serious trouble, you know, if I told anyone what you were saying.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Indeed I would. I am putting my trust completely at your discretion.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Because you are very pretty and very smart, and until I was sent here I hadn&#x2019;t spoken to a girl who was either in a very, very long time.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Spare me,&#x201d; she said, but she couldn&#x2019;t help being flattered. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve gone just as long without the company of boys. They&#x2019;re all off fighting somewhere.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ah, but then your navy men arrived,&#x201d; he said, and she realized he was actually a little jealous of them. He seemed about to say more when Wally returned, this time accompanied by the Yorkshire schoolteacher named Arthur Frost. &#x201c;Come along, Callum,&#x201d; Arthur said firmly, &#x201c;those apples won&#x2019;t pick themselves. No more dillydallying.&#x201d;<br><br>Callum nodded agreeably and left, turning back to Anna once to bring his index and middle finger to the tip of his lips. At the time, she thought he was shushing her; later, she would conclude he had in fact blown her a kiss.<br><br>theo moved two of his toy cavalrymen to the front of his column, and then had them ride to the river that Anna had helped him paint a year ago now on a piece of barn board. The board was at least a meter and a half square and he could carry it by himself&#x2014;but just barely. Helmut had found it and his father had sanded it flat. In addition to the river, he and Anna had also painted trees and wooden fences on it, and a long tren...</p><h2>The Beautiful and Damned: A Twentieth Century Classic</h2><p>&#34;The Beautiful and Damned&#34;, first published in 1922, was F. Scott Fitzgerald&#39;s second novel. It tells the story of Anthony Patch (a 1920s socialite and presumptive heir to a tycoon&#39;s fortune), his relationship with his wife Gloria, his service in the army, and alcoholism. The novel provides an excellent portrait of the Eastern elite as the Jazz Age begins its ascent, engulfing all classes into what will soon be known as Caf� Society. As with all of his other novels, it is a brilliant character study and is also an early account of the complexities of marriage and intimacy that were further explored in &#34;Tender Is the Night.&#34; The book is believed to be largely based on Fitzgerald&#39;s relationship and marriage with Zelda Fitzgerald.</p><p>This edition includes a detailed account of the composition of the novel, a textual apparatus, a chronology of composition, and, uniquely, three versions of the ending. Explanatory notes situate The Beautiful and Damned in its times and deepen the reader&#39;s understanding of Fitzgerald&#39;s sources for the novel.Following the great critical and financial success of his first novel, <i>This Side of Paradise,</i> F. Scott Fitzgerald published <i>The Beautiful and the Damned</i> in 1922. An immediate success upon its first publication, Fitzgerald's second novel is a dazzling portrait of love and life among the beautiful people. Through the story of two newlyweds, Anthony Patch of New York and Gloria Gilbert of Kansas City, Fitzgerald flawlessly captures the heady atmosphere and jaded values of the Jazz Age. Patch, expecting to become the sole heir to his grandfather's millions, embraces a life of endless parties and intellectual pretensions. In Gloria, he finds an exquisite ornament and a passionate lover. The couple whirls through days that mirror Fitzgerald's own--a fast life amid a smart set for which there is never enough cash. Beginning with wit and clever repartee, <i>The Beautiful and the Damned</i> quickly becomes a scathing chronicle of a dying marriage and a hedonistic society where beauty is all too fleeting. Through the character of Richard Caramel, a successful hack writer whose talent fails as he prospers, Fitzgerald caricatures himself. But today's readers will find an even more poignant self-portrait of Fitzgerald and his wife Zelda in Anthony and Gloria, a couple whose days of wine and roses fade quickly toward a tragic end.</p><h2>Eat for Health: Lose Weight, Keep It Off, Look Younger, Live Longer, Book 2 - The Body Makeover</h2><p>2008 Hardcover.

While this recovery invokes a return of past traditions and ideas, it also implies renewal, invention, and transformation. <i>Recovering Landscape</i> collects a number of essays that discuss why landscape is gaining increased attention today, and what new possibilities might emerge from this situation. Themes such as reclamation, urbanism, infrastructure, geometry, representation, and temporality are explored in discussions drawn from recent developments not only in the United States but also in the Netherlands, France, India, and Southeast Asia. The contributors to this collection, all leading figures in the field of landscape architecture, include Alan Balfour, Denis Cosgrove, Georges Descombes, Christophe Girot, Steen Hoyer, David Leatherbarrow, Bart Lootsma, Sebastien Marot, Anuradha Mathur, Marc Treib, and Alex Wall.</p><p>James Corner James Corner is an associate professor of architecture at the University of Pennsylvania. He is co-author of the award-winning title Taking Measures Across the American Landscape.This highly theoretical collection of essays is based partly on a symposium held at the Architectural Association in London in 1994. In his introduction, Corner (landscape architecture, Univ. of Pennsylvania) nicely frames the book with discussions of the semantics of the word landscape and its further cultural connotations while also describing how it is regarded by preservationists and represented in advertising. The volume is divided into three parts: reclaiming place and time, constructing and representing landscape, and urbanizing landscape. The breadth of approaches is impressive, and the contributors ably describe the idea of landscape from a virtually infinite set of perspectives, from the sense of tactility to the distinctive site characteristics of airports. Nevertheless, this is recommended only for graduate-level collections in cultural and architectural theory.APaul Glassman, New York Sch. of Interior Design Lib. <br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Christmas Eve at the Mellops&#39;</h2><p>It is the day before Christmas and the four Mellops brothers all have the same idea ? to surprise their family with a Christmas tree.

Down in the eternal spring of the planet, however, the native Florinians labor ceaselessly to produce the precious kyrt that brings prosperity to their Sarkite masters. Rebellion is unthinkable and impossible. Not only do the Florinians no longer have a concept of freedom, any disruption of the vital kyrt trade would cause other planets to rise in protest, ultimately destabilizing trade and resulting in a galactic war. So the Trantorian Empire, whose grand plan is to unite all humanity in peace, prosperity, and freedom, has stood aside and allowed the oppression to continue. Living among the workers of Florinia, Rik is a man without a memory or a past. He has been abducted and brainwashed.

He was trembling so hard he had to lean against the bare milk- white wall. <p></p> <p></p>He shouted, "I remember!" <p></p> <p></p>They looked at him and the gritty mumble of men at lunch died somewhat. Eyes met his out of faces indifferently clean and indifferently shaven, glistening and white in the imperfect wall illumination. The eyes reflected no great interest, merely the reflex attention enforced by any sudden and unexpected cry. <p></p> <p></p>Rik cried again, "I remember my job. I had a job!" <p></p> <p></p>Someone called, "Shoddop!"and someone else yelled, "Siddown!" <p></p> <p></p>The faces turned away, the mumble rose again. Rik stared blankly along the table. He heard the remark, "Crazy Rik,"and a shrug of shoulders. He saw a finger spiral at a man&#x2019;s temple. It all meant nothing to him. None of it reached his mind. <p></p> <p></p>Slowly he sat down. Again he clutched his feeder, a spoon-like affair, with sharp edges and little tines projecting from the front curve of the bowl, which could therefore with equal clumsiness cut, scoop and impale. It was enough for a mill-worker. He turned it over and stared without seeing at his number on the back of the handle. He didn&#x2019;t have to see it. He knew it by heart. All the others had registration numbers, just as he had, but the others had names also. He didn&#x2019;t. They called him Rik because it meant something like "moron"in the slang of the kyrt mills. And often enough they called him "Crazy Rik." <p></p> <p></p>But perhaps he would be remembering more and more now. This was the first time since he had come to the mill that he had remembered anything at all from before the beginning. If he thought hard! If he thought with all his mind! <p></p> <p></p>All at once he wasn&#x2019;t hungry; he wasn&#x2019;t the least hungry. With a sudden gesture, he thrust his feeder into the jellied briquet of meat and vegetables before him, pushed the food away, and buried his eyes in the heels of his palms. His fingers thrust and clutched at his hair and painstakingly he tried to follow his mind into the pitch from which it had extracted a single item&#x2014;one muddy, undecipherable item. <p></p> <p></p>Then he burst into tears, just as the clanging bell announced the end of his lunch shift. <p></p> <p></p>Valona March fell in beside him when he left the mill that evening. He was scarcely conscious of her at first, at least as an individual. It was only that he heard his footsteps matched. He stopped and looked at her. Her hair was something between blonde and brown. She wore it in two thick plaits that she clamped together with little magnetized green- stoned pins. They were very cheap pins and had a faded look about them. She wore the simple cotton dress which was all that was needed in that mild climate, just as Rik himself needed only an open, sleeveless shirt and cotton slacks. <p></p> <p></p>She said, "I heard something went wrong lunchtime." <p></p> <p></p>She spoke in the sharp, peasant accents one would expect. Rik&#x2019;s own language was full of flat vowels and had a nasal touch. They laughed at him because of it and imitated his way of speaking, but Valona would tell him that that was only their own ignorance. <p></p> <p></p>Rik mumbled, "Nothing&#x2019;s wrong, Lona." <p></p> <p></p>She persisted. "I heard you said you remembered something. Is that right, Rik?" <p></p> <p></p>She called him Rik too. There wasn&#x2019;t anything else to call him. He couldn&#x2019;t remember his real name. He had tried desperately enough. Valona had tried with him. One day she had obtained a torn city directory somehow and had read all the first names to him. None had seemed more familiar than any other. <p></p> <p></p>He looked her full in the face and said, "I&#x2019;ll have to quit the mill." <p></p> <p></p>Valona frowned. Her round, broad face with its flat, high cheekbones was troubled. "I don&#x2019;t think you can. It wouldn&#x2019;t be right." <p></p> <p></p>"I&#x2019;ve got to find out more about myself." <p></p> <p></p>Valona licked her lips. "I don&#x2019;t think you should." <p></p> <p></p>Rik turned away. He knew her concern to be sincere. She had obtained the mill job for him in the first place. He had had no experience with mill machinery. Or perhaps he had, but just didn&#x2019;t remember. In any case, Lona had insisted that he was too small for manual labor and they had agreed to give him technical training without charge. Before that, in the nightmarish days when he could scarcely make sounds and when he didn&#x2019;t know what food was for, she had watched him and fed him. She had kept him alive. <p></p> <p></p>He said, "I&#x2019;ve got to." <p></p> <p></p>"Is it the headaches again, Rik?" <p></p> <p></p>"No. I really remember something. I remember what my job was before&#x2014;&#x2014;Before!" <p></p> <p></p>He wasn&#x2019;t sure he wanted to tell her. He looked away. The warm, pleasant sun was at least two hours above the horizon. The monotonous rows of workers&#x2019; cubicles that stretched out and round the mills were tiresome to look at, but Rik knew that as soon as they topped the rise the field would lie before them in all the beauty of crimson and gold. <p></p> <p></p>He liked to look at the fields. From the very first the sight had soothed and pleased him. Even before he knew that the colors were crimson and gold, before he knew that there were such things as colors, before he could express his plea sure in anything more than a soft gurgle, the headaches would flicker away faster in the fields. In those days Valona would borrow a diamagnetic scooter and take him out of the village every idle-day. They would skim along, a foot above the road, gliding on the cushioned smoothness of the counter- gravity field, until they were miles and miles away from any human habitation and there would be left only the wind against his face, fragrant with the kyrt blossoms. <p></p> <p></p>They would sit beside the road then, surrounded by color and scent, and between them share a food briquet, while the sun glowed down upon them until it was time to return again. <p></p> <p></p>Rik was stirred by the memory. He said, "Let&#x2019;s go to the fields, Lona." <p></p> <p></p>"It&#x2019;s late." <p></p> <p></p>"Please. Just outside town." <p></p> <p></p>She fumbled at the thin money pouch she kept between herself and the soft blue leather belt she wore, the only luxury of dress she allowed herself. <p></p> <p></p>Rik caught her arm. "Let&#x2019;s walk." <p></p> <p></p>They left the highway for the winding, dustless, packed- sand roads half an hour later. There was a heavy silence between them and Valona felt a familiar fear clutching at her. She had no words to express her feelings for him, so she had never tried. <p></p> <p></p>What if he should leave her? He was a little fellow, no taller than herself and weighing somewhat less, in fact. He was still like a helpless child in many ways. But before they had turned his mind off he must have been an educated man. A very important educated man. <p></p> <p></p>Valona had never had any education besides reading and writing and enough trade- school technology to be able to handle mill machinery, but she knew enough to know that all people were not so limited. There was the Townman, of course, whose great knowledge was so helpful to all of them. Occasionally Squires came on inspection tours. She had never seen them close up but once, on a holiday, she had visited the City and seen a group of incredibly gorgeous creatures at a distance. Occasionally the mill-workers were allowed to listen to what educated people sounded like. They spoke differently, more fluently, with longer words and softer tones. Rik talked like that more and more as his memory improved. <p></p> <p></p>She had been frightened at his first words. They came so suddenly after long whimpering over a headache. They were pronounced queerly. When she tried to correct him he wouldn&#x2019;t change. <p></p> <p></p>Even then she had been afraid that he might remember too much and then leave her. She was only Valona March. They called her Big Lona. She had never married. She never would. A large, big- footed girl with work- reddened hands like herself could never marry. She had never been able to do more than look at the boys with dumb resentment when they ignored her at the idle- day dinner festivals. She was too big to giggle and smirk at them. <p></p> <p></p>She would never have a baby to cuddle and hold. The other girls did, one after the other, and she could only crowd about for a quick glimpse of something red and hairless with screwed-up eyes, fists impotently clenched, gummy mouth&#x2014;&#x2014; <p></p> <p></p>"It&#x2019;s your turn next, Lona." <p></p> <p></p>"When will you have a baby, Lona?" <p></p> <p></p>She could only turn away. <p></p> <p></p>But when Rik had come, he was like a baby. He had to be fed and taken care of, brought out into the sun, soothed to sleep when the headaches racked him. <p></p> <p></p>The children would run after her, laughing. They would yell, "Lona&#x2019;s got a boy friend. Big Lona&#x2019;s got a crazy boy...</p><h2>Tailspin</h2><p><b>A daring pilot races against time to deliver an important package -- and keep it from falling into the wrong hands -- in this #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling thriller of spine-tingling suspense and tantalizing romance.</b><br><br>Rye Mallett, a fearless "freight dog" pilot charged with flying cargo to far-flung locations, is rough-spoken and all business, but soft on regulations when they get in the way of meeting a deadline.

An account of the Chicago World&#39;s Fair of 1893 relates the stories of two men who shaped the history of the event: architect Daniel H. Burnham, who coordinated its construction, and serial killer Herman Mudgett.</p><p>Author Erik Larson imbues the incredible events surrounding the 1893 Chicago World's Fair with such drama that readers may find themselves checking the book's categorization to be sure that <i>The Devil in the White City</i> is not, in fact, a highly imaginative novel. Larson tells the stories of two men: Daniel H. Burnham, the architect responsible for the fair's construction, and H.H. Holmes, a serial killer masquerading as a charming doctor. Burnham's challenge was immense. In a short period of time, he was forced to overcome the death of his partner and numerous other obstacles to construct the famous "White City" around which the fair was built. His efforts to complete the project, and the fair's incredible success, are skillfully related along with entertaining appearances by such notables as Buffalo Bill Cody, Susan B. Anthony, and Thomas Edison. The activities of the sinister Dr. Holmes, who is believed to be responsible for scores of murders around the time of the fair, are equally remarkable. He devised and erected the World's Fair Hotel, complete with crematorium and gas chamber, near the fairgrounds and used the event as well as his own charismatic personality to lure victims. Combining the stories of an architect and a killer in one book, mostly in alternating chapters, seems like an odd choice but it works. The magical appeal and horrifying dark side of 19th-century Chicago are both revealed through Larson's skillful writing. <i>--John Moe</i>Two men, each handsome and unusually adept at his chosen work, embodied an element of the great dynamic that characterized America's rush toward the twentieth century. The architect was Daniel Hudson Burnham, the fair's brilliant director of works and the builder of many of the country's most important structures, including the Flatiron Building in New York and Union Station in Washington, D.C. The murderer was Henry H. Holmes, a young doctor who, in a malign parody of the White City, built his "World's Fair Hotel" just west of the fairgrounds--a torture palace complete with dissection table, gas chamber, and 3,000-degree crematorium. Burnham overcame tremendous obstacles and tragedies as he organized the talents of Frederick Law Olmsted, Charles McKim, Louis Sullivan, and others to transform swampy Jackson Park into the White City, while Holmes used the attraction of the great fair and his own satanic charms to lure scores of young women to their deaths. What makes the story all the more chilling is that Holmes really lived, walking the grounds of that dream city by the lake. <br>The Devil in the White City draws the reader into a time of magic and majesty, made all the more appealing by a supporting cast of real-life characters, including Buffalo Bill, Theodore Dreiser, Susan B. Anthony, Thomas Edison, Archduke Francis Ferdinand, and others. In this book the smoke, romance, and mystery of the Gilded Age come alive as never before. <br>Erik Larson's gifts as a storyteller are magnificently displayed in this rich narrative of the master builder, the killer, and the great fair that obsessed them both. <br>To find out more about this book, go to http: //www.DevilInTheWhiteCity.com.</p><h2>Permaculture: Principles and Pathways beyond Sustainability</h2><p><p>David Holmgren brings into sharper focus the powerful and still evolving Permaculture concept he pioneered with Bill Mollison in the 1970s. It draws together and integrates 25 years of thinking and teaching to reveal a whole new way of understanding and action behind a simple set of design principles. The 12 design principles are each represented by a positive action statement, an icon and a traditional proverb or two that captures the essence of each principle.</p> <p>Holmgren draws a correlation between every aspect of how we organize our lives, communities and landscapes and our ability to creatively adapt to the ecological realities that shape human destiny. For students and teachers of Permaculture this book provides something more fundamental and distilled than Mollison's encyclopedic <em>Designers Manual</em>. For the general reader it provides refreshing perspectives on a range of environmental issues and shows how permaculture is much more than just a system of gardening. For anyone seriously interested in understanding the foundations of sustainable design and culture, this book is essential reading. Although a book of ideas, the big picture is repeatedly grounded by reference to Holmgren's own place, Melliodora, and other practical examples.</p></p><p>Amazon cannot sell this book to Australia or New Zealand<p>David Holmgren is best known as the co-originator with Bill Mollison of the permaculture concept following the publication of <em>Permaculture One</em> in 1978. Since then he has written several more books, developed three properties using permaculture principles, conducted workshops and courses in Australia, New Zealand, Europe and Japan. Within the growing and international permaculture movement, David is respected for his commitment to presenting permaculture ideas through practical projects and teaching by personal example, that a sustainable lifestyle is a realistic, attractive and powerful alternative to dependent consumerism. As well as constant involvement in the practical side of permaculture, David is passionate about the philosophical and conceptual foundations for sustainability, which he explored in F<em>uture Scenarios: How Communities Can Adapt to Peak Oil and Climate Change&nbsp;</em>(2009), and <em>Permaculture: Principles and Pathways Beyond Sustainability </em>(2003). With an increasingly high profile as a public speaker, David Holmgren provides leadership with his refreshing and unorthodox approach to the environmental issues of our time.<br><br> David lives with his partner Su Dennett and their son Oliver at "Melliodora", a one-hectare permaculture demonstration site at Hepburn Springs, Central Victoria, Australia.

Susie Middleton shares her love of great-tasting veggies with a guide to stocking up the pantry, shopping for vegetables, and cooking those veggies in 9 different ways. <i>Fast, Fresh &amp; Green</i> is uniquely organized by technique so that cooks can add new ways to cook veggies to their weeknight repertoires. More than 100 recipes for side dishes--many that can double as starters or main dishes, and many that are vegan--include Spinach with Shallots and Parmigiano, Sweet Potato Mini Fries with Limey Dipping Sauce, Roasted Broccoli with Two Dipping Sauces, Braised Fingerlings with Rosemary and Mellow Garlic, and Summer Vegetable Ragout.&nbsp;<i>Fast,&nbsp;</i><i>Fresh &amp; Green</i>&nbsp;is an excellent resource for vegetarians and omnivores alike.</p><p>I couldn't be happier with my first cookbook, <i>Fast, Fresh &amp; Green</i>. It's beautiful (thank you to Chronicle Books and my fabulous photographer Ben Fink!), and I feel like my mission--to help people learn more easy and delicious ways to cook vegetables--really comes to life on these pages. When I was Editor of <i>Fine Cooking</i> magazine, I noticed that our vegetable side dish features were always very popular, that folks really wanted to cook more vegetables but struggled with how to cook them and with making dishes that everyone in the family would like. I could relate! As a little girl, I was such a picky eater that my mother let me put sour cream on my vegetables just to get them down me. But that all changed when I started to cook for myself, went to culinary school, worked in great restaurants, and began to understand that vegetables don't need to be handled with kid gloves. In fact, the kiss of high heat brings out their sweetness; and roasting, braising, sauteing, and grilling are all great ways to make vegetables tasty.<br>To that end, I wanted my book to be organized by technique (instead of being just another recipe collection). So I developed 9 great ways to cook vegetables (8 are quick and perfect for weeknights; the ninth is a slower-but-worth-it bonus gratin chapter), and also included a master recipe for each technique that you can customize with your own flavor choices. But realizing that a lot of cooks just like to jump into a recipe to get started, I've included more than 90 other recipes, too, so that you can get friendly with vegetables however you like. I hope you enjoy <i>Fast, Fresh &amp; Green</i>, and I promise you that you'll definitely find at least one (hopefully many) new go-to weeknight vegetable dishes in this book.&nbsp;Susie Middleton is a chef, food writer, recipe developer and magazine consultant.

He lives in Melbourne, Australia."He's coming around."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Their eyes always do that."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;The world was blurry. There was a pressure in his right eye. He said, <i>Urk.</i><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fuck!"<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Get the&#x2014;"<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's too late, forget it. Take it out."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's not too late. Hold him." A shape grew in his vision. He smelled alcohol and stale urine. "Wil? Can you hear me?"<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;He reached for his face, to brush away whatever was pressing there.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Get his&#x2014;"<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Fingers closed around his wrist. "Wil, it's important that you not touch your face."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why is he conscious?"<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"You fucked something up."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I didn't. Give me that."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;A rustling. He said,<i> Hnnn. Hnnnn.</i><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stop moving." He felt breath in his ear, hot and intimate. "There is a needle in your eyeball. Do not move."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not move. Something trilled, something electronic. "Ah,shit, shit."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?"<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"They're here."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Already?"<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two of them, it says. We have to go."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I'm already in."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can't do it while he's conscious.

Weight descended on his chest. His vision darkened. His eyeball moved slightly.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"This may hurt."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;A <i>snick</i>. A low electronic whine. A rail spike drove into his brain.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;He screamed.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"You're toasting him."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"You're okay, Wil. You're okay."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"He's . . . aw, he's bleeding from his eye."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wil, I need you to answer a few questions. It's important that you answer truthfully. Do you understand?"<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>No no no&#x2014;</i><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"First question. Would you describe yourself as more of a dog person or cat person?"<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>What&#x2014;</i><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come on, Wil. Dog or cat?"<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can't read this.

Yeah, okay."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;A hand closed over his mouth. The pressure in his eyeball intensified, became a sucking. They were pulling out his eyeball. No: It was the needle, withdrawing. He shrieked, possibly. Then the pain was gone. Hands pulled him upward. He couldn't see. He wept for his poor abused eyeball. But it was still there. It was there.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Blurry shapes loomed in fog. "What," Wil said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"<i>Coarg medicity nighten comense,</i>" said the taller shape. "Hop on one foot."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Wil squinted, confused.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Huh," said the shorter shape. "Maybe it is him."<br><br>They filled a sink with water and pushed his face into it. He surfaced, gasping. "Don't soak his clothes," said the tall man.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;He was in a restroom. An airport. He had come off the 3:05 p. m. from Chicago, where the aisle seat had been occupied by a large man in a Hawaiian shirt Wil couldn't bear to wake. At first, the restroom had appeared closed for cleaning, but the janitor had removed the sign and Wil had jagged toward it gratefully. He had reached the urinal, unzipped, experienced relief.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;The door had opened. A tall man in a beige coat had come in. There were half a dozen free urinals, Wil at one end, but the man chose the one beside him. Moments passed and the tall man did not pee. Wil, emptying at high velocity, felt a twinge of compassion. He had been there. The door had opened again. A second man entered and locked the door.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Wil had put himself back in his pants. He had looked at the man beside him, thinking&#x2014;this was funny, in retrospect&#x2014;that whatever was happening here, whatever specific danger was implied by a man entering a public restroom and fucking <i>locking</i> it, at least Wil and the tall man were in it together. At least it was two against one. Then he had realized Shy Bladder Guy's eyes were calm and deep and kind of beautiful, actually, but the key point being <i>calm as in unsurprised</i>, and Shy Bladder Guy had seized his head and propelled him into the wall.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the pain, and questions.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Have to get this blood out of his hair," said the short man. He attacked Wil's face with paper towels. "His eye looks terrible."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"If they get close enough to see his eyes, we have bigger problems."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;The tall man was wiping his hands with a small white cloth, giving attention to each finger. He was thin and dark-skinned and Wil was no longer finding his eyes quite so beautiful. He was getting more of a cold, soulless kind of vibe. Like those eyes could watch terrible things and not look away. "So, Wil, you with us? You can walk and talk?"<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fuck," he said, "orrffff." It didn't come out like he meant. His head felt loose.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good," said the tall man. "So here's the deal. We need to get out of this airport in minimum time with minimum fuss. I want your cooperation with that. If I fail to receive it, I'm going to make things bad for you. Not because I have anything against you, particularly, but I need you motivated. Do you understand?"<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I'm not . . ." He searched for the word. <i>Rich? Kidnappable?</i> "Anybody. I'm a carpenter. I make decks. Balconies. Gazebos."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, that's why we're here, your inimitable work with gazebos. You can forget the act. We know who you are. And <i>they</i> know who you are, and they're <i>here</i>, so let's get the fuck out while we can."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a moment to choose his words, because he had the feeling he would get only one more shot at this. "My name is Wil Parke. I'm a carpenter. I have a girlfriend and she's waiting out front to pick me up. I don't know who you think I am, or why you stuck a . . . a thing in my eye, but I'm nobody. I promise you I'm nobody."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;The short man had been packing equipment into a brown satchel,and now he slung it around one shoulder and peered into Wil's face. He had thinning hair and anxious brows. Wil might have pegged him for an accountant, ordinarily.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I tell you what," Wil said. "I'll go into a stall and close the door. Twenty minutes. I'll wait twenty minutes. It'll be like we never met."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;The short man glanced at the tall man.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I'm not the guy," Wil said. "I am not the guy."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"The problem with that little plan, Wil," said the tall man, "is that if you stay here, in twenty minutes you'll be dead. If you go to your girlfriend, who I'm sorry to say you can no longer trust, you'll also be dead. If you do anything other than come with us now, quickly and cooperatively, again, I'm afraid, dead. It may not seem like it, but we are the only people who can save you from that." His eyes searched Wil's. "I can see, though, that you're not finding this very persuasive, so let me switch to a more direct method." He held open his coat. Nestled against his side, nose down in a thigh holster, was a short, wide shotgun. It made no sense, because they were in an airport.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come or I will shoot you through the fucking kidneys."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," Wil said. "Okay, you make a good point. I'll cooperate." The key was to get out of the restroom. The airport was full of security. Once he was out, a push, a yell, some running: This was how he would escape.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nope," said the short man.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"No," agreed the tall man. "I see it. Dope him up."<br><br>A door opened. On the other side of it was a world of stunted color and muted sound, as if something was stuck in Wil's ears, and eyes, and possibly brain. He shook his head to clear it, but the world grew dark and angry and would not stay upright. The world did not like to be shaken. He understood that now. He wouldn't shake it again. He felt his feet sliding away from him on silent roller skates and reached for a wall for support. The wall cursed and dug its fingers into his arm, and was probably not a wall. It was probably a person.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"You gave him too much," said the person.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Safe than sorry," said another person. They were bad persons, Wil recalled. They were kidnapping him. He felt angry about this, although in a technical kind of way, like taking a stand on principle. He tried to reel in his roller skate feet.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Jesus," muttered a person, the tall one with calm eyes. Wil didn't like this person. He'd forgotten why. No. It was the kidnapping. "Walk."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked, resentfully. There were important facts in his brain but he couldn't find them. Everything was moving. A stream of airport people broke around him. Everyone going somewhere. Wil had been going somewhere. Meeting someone. To his left, a bird twittered. Or a phone. The short man squinted at a screen. "Rain."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where?"<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Domestic Arrivals. Right ahead." Wil found this idea amusing: rain in the terminal. "Do we know a Rain?"<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yeah. Girl. New."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shit," said the short man. "I hate shooting girls."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"You get used to it," said the tall man.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;A young couple passed, gripping hands. Lovers. The concept seemed familiar. "This way," said the tall man, steering Wil into a bookstore. He came face-to-face with a shelf that said NEW RELEASES. Wil's feet kept skating and he put out a hand to catch himself and felt a sharp pain.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Problem?"<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Possibly nothing," murmured the tall man, "or possibly Rain, passing behind us now, in a blue summer dress."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;In glossy covers, a reflection skipped by. Wil was trying to figure out what had stabbed him. It was a loose wire in the NEW RELEASES sign. The interesting thing was that being stabbed had helped to clear the fog in his head.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Busiest part of any store, always the new releases," said the tall man. "That's what attracts people. Not the best. The new. Why is that, Wil, do you think?"<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Wil pricked himself with the wire. He was too tentative, could hardly feel it, and so tried again, harder. This time a blade of pain swept through his mind. He remembered needles and questions. His girlfriend, Cecilia, was out front in a white SUV. She would be in a two-minute parking bay; they had arranged that carefully. He was late, because of these guys.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think we're good," said the short man.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Make sure." The short man moved away. "All right, Wil," said the tall man. "In a few moments, we're going to cross the hall and walk down some stairs. There will be a little circumnavigating of passenger jets, then we'll board a nice, comfortable twelve-seater. There will be snacks. Drinks, if you're thirsty." The tall man glanced at him. "Still with me?"<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Wil grabbed the man's face. He had no plan for what to do next, so wound up just hanging on to the guy's head and staggering backward until he tripped over a cardboard display. The two of them went down in a tangle of beige coat and scattered books. <i>Run</i>, Wil thought, and yes, that was a solid idea. He found his feet and ran for the exit. In the glass he saw a wild-eyed man and realized it was him. He heard yelps and alarmed voices, possibly the tall man getting up, who had a shotgun, Wil recalled now, <i>a shotgun</i>, which was not the kind of thing you would think could slip your memory.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;He stumbled out into an ocean of bright frightened faces and open mouths. It was hard to remember what he was doing. His legs threatened treachery but the motion was good, helping to clear his head. He saw escalators and forged toward them. His back sang with potential shotgun impacts, but the airport people were being very good about moving out of his way, practically <i>throwing</i> themselves aside, for which he was grateful. He reached the escalators but his roller skate feet kept going and he fell flat on his back. The ceiling moved slowly by. The tiles up there were filthy. They were seriously disgusting.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;He sat up, remembering Cecilia. Also the shotgun. And, now he thought about it, how about some security? Where were they? Because it was an airport. It was an <i>airport</i>. He grabbed the handrail, intending to pull himself up to look for security, but his knees went in opposite directions and he tumbled down the rest of the way. Body parts telegraphed complaints from faraway places. He rose. Sweat ran into his eyes. Because the head fog wasn't confusing enough; he needed <i>blurred vision</i>. But he could see light, which meant <i>exit</i>, which meant <i>Cecilia</i>, so he ran on. Someone shouted. The light grew. Frigid air burst around him as if he'd plunged into a mountain lake and he sucked it into his lungs. Snow, he saw. It was snowing. Flakes like tiny stars.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Help, guy with gun," he said to a man who looked like a cop but on reflection was probably directing cabs. Orange buses. Parking bays. The two-minute spaces were just a little farther. He a...</p><h2>A Little Life: The Million-Copy Bestseller</h2><p><p><b>Shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize 2015</b></p><p><i>A Little Life</i> by Hanya Yanagihara is an immensely powerful and heartbreaking novel of brotherly love and the limits of human endurance.</p><p>When four graduates from a small Massachusetts college move to New York to make their way, they're broke, adrift, and buoyed only by their friendship and ambition. There is kind, handsome Willem, an aspiring actor; JB, a quick-witted, sometimes cruel Brooklyn-born painter seeking entry to the art world; Malcolm, a frustrated architect at a prominent firm; and withdrawn, brilliant, enigmatic Jude, who serves as their centre of gravity. Over the decades, their relationships deepen and darken, tinged by addiction, success, and pride. Yet their greatest challenge, each comes to realize, is Jude himself, by midlife a terrifyingly talented litigator yet an increasingly broken man, his mind and body scarred by an unspeakable childhood, and haunted by what he fears is a degree of trauma that he'll not only be unable to overcome - but that will define his life forever.</p></p><p>Utterly gripping. Wonderfully romantic and sometimes harrowing, <i>A Little Life</i> kept me reading late into the night, night after night (Edmund White)<br><br>One of the pleasures of fiction is how suddenly a brilliant writer can alter the literary landscape . . . Ms. Yanagihara's immense new book . . . announces her, as decisively as a second work can, as a major American novelist. Here is an epic study of trauma and friendship written with such intelligence and depth of perception that it will be one of the benchmarks against which all other novels that broach those subjects (and they are legion) will be measured. In recent years, only Edward St. Aubyn's Patrick Melrose novels have confronted with similarly enduring power the long aftermath of abuse (and the sleepless duties required in loving abuse victims). But while Mr. St. Aubyn's writing relies on matador-like thrusts of barbed irony, <i>A Little Life</i> achieves its lasting effect with calm, thoroughgoing realism. There's an amazing sense of totality in the portrayals here, and in Jude especially. He is fragmented by fear and shame, but Ms. Yanagihara depicts him as a man in full. His life, the precarious essence of this important novel, is not less than an odyssey of survival (<i>Wall Street Journal</i>)<br><br>Martin Amis once asked, "Who else but Tolstoy has made happiness really swing on the page?" And the surprising answer is that Hanya Yanagihara has: counterintuitively, the most moving parts of "A Little Life" are not its most brutal but its tenderest ones, moments when Jude receives kindness and support from his friends . . . "A Little Life" feels elemental, irreducible-and, dark and disturbing though it is, there is beauty in it (Jon Michaud <i>New Yorker</i>)<br><br>How often is a novel so deeply disturbing that you might find yourself weeping, and yet so revelatory about human kindness that you might also feel touched by grace? Yanagihara's astonishing and unsettling second novel . . . plumbs the rich inner lives of all of her characters... You don't just care deeply about all these lives. Thanks to the author's exquisite skill, you feel as if you are living them . . . <i>A Little Life</i> is about the unimaginable cruelty of human beings, the savage things done to a child and his lifelong struggle to overcome the damage. Its pages are soaked with grief, but it's also about the bottomless human capacity for love and endurance . . . It's not hyperbole to call this novel a masterwork - if anything that word is simply just too little for it (<i>San Francisco Chronicle</i>)<br><br>[The] spring's must-read novel . . . Her debut . . . put her on the literary map, her massive new novel . . . signals the arrival of a major new voice in fiction . . . Her achievement has less to do with size than with her powerful evocation of the fragility of self . . . the pained beauty that suffuses this novel, an American epic that eloquently counters our culture's fixation with redemptive narratives. (<i>Vogue US</i>)<br><br>The triumph of <i>A Little Life's</i> many pages is significant: It wraps us so thoroughly in a character's life that his trauma, his struggles, his griefs come to seem as familiar and inescapable as our own. There's no one way to experience loss, abuse, or the effects of trauma, of course, but the vividness of Jude's character and experiences makes the pain almost tangible, the fall-out more comprehensible. It's a monument of empathy, and that alone makes this novel wondrous (<i>Huffington Post</i>)<br><br>Often painful but thoroughly brilliant . . . Yanagihara's massive new novel . . . is hurtful. That's because, among other things, it is the enthralling and completely immersive story of one man's unyielding pain. It also asks a compelling question: Can friends save us? Even from ourselves? . . . Yanagihara's close study of [her characters'] lives and Jude's trauma makes for a stunning work of fiction (<i>New York Daily News</i>)<br><br>This spellbinding, feverish novel sucks you in . . . One of the most compassionate, moving stories of our time . . . An exquisitely written, complex triumph (<i>Oprah.com</i>)<br><br>A darkly beautiful tale of love and friendship... I've read a lot of emotionally taxing books in my time, but <i>A Little Life</i> . . . is the only one I've read as an adult that's left me sobbing. I became so invested in the characters and their lives that I almost felt unqualified to review this book objectively . . . There are truths here that are almost too much to bear - that hope is a qualified thing, that even love, no matter how pure and freely given, is not always enough. This book made me realize how merciful most fiction really is, even at its darkest, and it's a testament to Yanagihara's ability that she can take such ugly material and make it beautiful (<i>Los Angeles Times</i>)<br><br>Capacious and consuming . . . Boast[s] a scale and immersive power to rival the recent epics of Donna Tartt and Elizabeth Gilbert . . . Alternately devastating and draining, <i>A Little Life</i> floats all sorts of troubling questions about the responsibility of the individual to those nearest and dearest and the sometime futility of playing brother's keeper. Those questions, accompanied by Yanagihara's exquisitely imagined characters, will shadow your dreamscapes (<i>Boston Globe</i>)A novel of extraordinary intelligence and heart, a masterful depiction of heartbreak, and a dark and haunting examination of the tyranny of experience and memory.</p><h2>PETER AND THE WOLF (Disney&#39;s Wonderful World of Reading, 20)</h2><p>Retells Sergei Prokofiev&#39;s fairy tale of a Russian boy who captures a wolf with the help of a bird, duck, and cat.</p><p></p><h2>Peter Pan Must Die (Dave Gurney, No. 4): A Novel (A Dave Gurney Novel)</h2><p>In John Verdon&#x2019;s most sensationally twisty novel yet, ingenious puzzle solver Dave Gurney brings his analytical brilliance to a shocking murder that couldn&#x2019;t have been committed the way the police say it was.<br><br>The daunting task that confronts Gurney, once the NYPD&#x2019;s top homicide cop: determining the guilt or innocence of a woman already convicted of shooting her charismatic politician husband -- who was felled by a rifle bullet to the brain while delivering the eulogy at his own mother&#x2019;s funeral.&nbsp; <br><br>Peeling back the layers, Gurney quickly finds himself waging a dangerous battle of wits with a thoroughly corrupt investigator, a disturbingly cordial mob boss, a gorgeous young temptress, and a bizarre assassin whose child-like appearance has earned him the nickname Peter Pan.<br><br>Startling twists and turns occur in rapid-fire sequence, and soon Gurney is locked inside one of the darkest cases of his career &#x2013; one in which multiple murders are merely the deceptive surface under which rests a scaffolding of pure evil.&nbsp; Beneath the tangle of poisonous lies, Gurney discovers that the truth is more shocking than anyone had imagined.<br>&nbsp;<br>And the identity of the villain at the mystery&#x2019;s center turns out to be the biggest shock of all.</p><p>JOHN VERDON is a former Manhattan advertising executive who lives with his wife in the mountains of upstate New York.&nbsp; His first three Dave Gurney novels, Think of a Number, Shut Your Eyes Tight, and Let the Devil Sleep, are all international bestsellers.<b><br>&#x201c;Verdon's plot devices are intelligently layered in "Peter Pan Must Die."

I could have been born anywhere, but it was most likely in Indianapolis, Indiana&#x2014;at least that&#x2019;s where I&#x2019;ve decided I was born, because that&#x2019;s where I was found. Specifically, I was found at Computer Partners Ltd. in the snack room, right by the coffeepot. I think it&#x2019;s one of the reasons that I like the taste of coffee&#x2014;it reminds me of home. I was found by Walt Lopper, a computer geek who had never so much as diapered a baby, but there I was, and I&#x2019;m told it was clear that I did need a new diaper. I needed a lot of other things, too, but my bottle wasn&#x2019;t empty, so the police felt that meant I hadn&#x2019;t been there long. Walt found me at seven a.m. on October third&#x2014;it was his turn to make coffee and he always got to work early. I was in my baby chair with a note:</p><p>pleez tek car of him Bcaz he my best boy <br>I no yur good!</p><p>There weren&#x2019;t any other clues about who left me there, but I&#x2019;m inclined to believe it was my mother, who might have worked nights cleaning office buildings. I had a little stuffed eagle that I was gnawing on, but other than that it was your usual thing. Walt called the police and they came and took me to the station and then someone from child services came and took me to a safe place, although Computer Partners Ltd. was a safe place, real safe, otherwise my mother wouldn&#x2019;t have left me there. I&#x2019;m told I didn&#x2019;t cry, I just watched people and took things in, but if you wanted to see what I was made of, try taking the stuffed eagle from my little hands. I&#x2019;d yank it back and screech, &#x201c;No!&#x201d;</p><p>They think I was nine months old when I was found, so saying &#x201c;no&#x201d; is a pretty big deal. Walt says it indicates I had a big brain, possibly like Einstein. Walt has a big brain. He&#x2019;s officially a computer genius, but even bigger than his brain is his heart, which he says he hadn&#x2019;t paid that much attention to until I came along.</p><p>The police tried to find the person who left me. I refuse to use the word<i> abandoned</i> because I&#x2019;m fairly certain that my mother loved me and didn&#x2019;t have much choice but to leave me. I&#x2019;m also fairly certain that she knew it was Walt&#x2019;s day to make the coffee. I think she probably checked out who was in that company and would never have left me there on a Monday, which was Dirk Dagwood&#x2019;s day to make coffee. From what I&#x2019;ve heard, he might not even have noticed a baby sitting there chewing on a stuffed eagle. He was that kind of clueless.</p><p>It took a while for Walt to adopt me, being a single man and all. He had to get trained and certified as a foster parent. It took another year of my living with him to convince the judge he should be my official dad. Walt spent a lot of time trying to figure me out, and I&#x2019;m told he talked to me like I was a baby genius. He read me articles from computer magazines, he took computers apart and told me what he was doing and why. During baseball season we watched the games together and he told me how the pitcher was trying to psych out the batter and what some of the signals meant. My favorite signal involved tapping your nose, which Walt said could mean anything, depending on the day. I tapped my nose a lot, and Walt carried me around explaining what everything was and how the world was a pretty complicated place, which I already knew.</p><p>When the adoption went through, Walt said, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s official now. Okay?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; I said. After that I started talking to Walt and to my stuffed eagle that I named Baby. I didn&#x2019;t talk to anyone else until later.</p><p>The problem with having a story like this is people don&#x2019;t know what to do with it. Their faces get super sad and their shoulders slump as they pat me on the head, which I find irritating, and say, &#x201c;My, you are a little survivor, aren&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;</p><p>Well, I suppose I am. But since I don&#x2019;t remember the first few years of my life, I don&#x2019;t feel like I can take any credit for it. And then there&#x2019;s the issue of my birthday, which is a theory, but schools seem to need an actual date, so I count three months ahead from October third when I was found to early January. I give the doctor a fudge factor in his estimate of one week, which puts my birthday on January tenth. Getting close is important to me.</p><p>I&#x2019;ve lived in four different places, because Walt is a consultant and has to move around a lot. At my last two schools my class was learning the recorder. I&#x2019;m so done with this instrument. I can play &#x201c;Go Tell Aunt Rhody&#x201d; in my sleep. I told Eddie Bartok, who was failing recorder, to pretend he was a snake charmer&#x2014;they play instruments like this and get the snakes to dance to the music. This caused Eddie to practice like crazy, but his mother wouldn&#x2019;t get him a snake. He tried charming worms in the garden, but worms today, they couldn&#x2019;t care less. He played &#x201c;Go Tell Aunt Rhody&#x201d; to his dog, who yelped and ran away. Once Eddie was at my house with his recorder and he tried to charm Baby.</p><p>&#x201c;Inanimate things don&#x2019;t respond!&#x201d; I mentioned.</p><p>And anyway, nobody can charm an eagle.</p><p>You can&#x2019;t keep an eagle in a cage or have one for a pet.</p><p>The number one rule for eagles is they have to be free.</p><p>I&#x2019;m sure this is why my mother gave me that stuffy. She knew I had an eagle inside of me. Not everybody does.</p><p>But when you do, you&#x2019;d better pay attention and deal with it, because if you don&#x2019;t, you&#x2019;ll have one intensely frustrating life.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Chapter<br>2</p><p>&#x201c;I HAVE A new consulting gig,&#x201d; Walt tells me. &#x201c;They pay up front.&#x201d;</p><p>This is excellent news, because lots of Walt&#x2019;s clients take forever to pay him. Walt has his own consulting company, the Magellan Group. It&#x2019;s not a group, exactly, and no one is named Magellan; it&#x2019;s named after Ferdinand Magellan, our favorite dead-for-centuries explorer, who, like Walt, worked 24/7.</p><p>&#x201c;Where is it?&#x201d; I ask.</p><p>&#x201c;Ohio.&#x201d;</p><p>We&#x2019;re living in St. Louis and I really, really like it here.</p><p>&#x201c;They need me for a couple of months, Jer. It&#x2019;s kind of an emergency.&#x201d;</p><p>Everything Walt does is somebody&#x2019;s emergency. No one calls my father and says, &#x201c;Hey, all systems are go here. Just wanted you to know.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Where in Ohio?&#x201d; I ask.</p><p>&#x201c;Near Cincinnati, but I don&#x2019;t think&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The Cincinnati Reds are looking strong this year, Walt.&#x201d; They&#x2019;re my third favorite team.</p><p>&#x201c;They are, but I don&#x2019;t think&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The name of the town, Walt&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A smaller place than Cincinnati. Hillcrest, Ohio.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They have a hill with a crest, right?&#x201d;</p><p>Walt laughs. &#x201c;Maybe. They have a company there and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>The &#x201c;and&#x201d; part is always &#x201c;and they need a little help.&#x201d; Believe me, when Walt Lopper gets called in, it&#x2019;s because people need a lot of help.</p><p>&#x201c;They&#x2019;ve got a little problem, Jer.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What kind of problem?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Their robots keep falling down.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s unclear.&#x201d;</p><p>I look in the corner. &#x201c;Jerwal, are you awake?&#x201d;</p><p>Jerwal, the robot Walt and I built together, glows and beeps.</p><p>Walt hasn&#x2019;t thought about taking any out-of-town business for a long time, because of my heart. Four years ago, I had a perfectly healthy heart. Then something called cardiomyopathy happened and everything changed.</p><p>I look at Walt, who sat with me every day I was in the hospital, who never once made me feel like I wasn&#x2019;t his kid, or was any kind of disappointment or a drain on his life.</p><p>&#x201c;When do you have to be there?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yesterday, Jer.&#x201d;</p><p>Today is March twenty-seventh, and lots is about to happen here.</p><p>The Cardinals&#x2019; opening day is April thirteenth and we have tickets.</p><p>The science fair at my school is coming up and I&#x2019;ve been working on a project that shows the trajectory of a well-hit baseball in 3-D. I&#x2019;ve been thinking about contacting the manager of the St. Louis Cardinals to come see it&#x2014;my findings could be big.</p><p>I take a deep breath and pull out my phone. Research is critical to decision making.</p><p>&#x201c;Hillcrest, Ohio,&#x201d; I read to him. &#x201c;Population 12,761, located in Ohio&#x2019;s rich farmland in the western part of the state. A small Midwestern town known for the excellence of its high school baseball program.&#x201d; This is getting interesting. &#x201c;The Hillcrest High School Hornets have won six state championships and twice clinched the nationals.&#x201d; I look up. &#x201c;We can gorge ourselves on baseball, Walt!&#x201d;</p><p>Walt&#x2019;s face has that half-sunk look it gets when he hasn&#x2019;t told me everything.</p><p>&#x201c;I think, Jer&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Well&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I called your aunt Charity&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Let me finish. I called her and she said she would stay here with you so you could finish school and&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I want you to stay near Dr. Feinberg.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;There are doctors in Cincinnati.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Wonderful doctors, no doubt.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Do you care about my heart, Walt?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What kind of a question is that?&#x201d;</p><p>An unfair question.</p><p>&#x201c;She treats me like I&#x2019;m a little kid!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I think if we talk to her&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve done that. Aunt Charity smothers me.&#x201d; I feel my face get hot. &#x201c;She makes me wash my hands hundreds of times.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You are supposed to avoid infection, my man.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Walt, please. I don&#x2019;t need to be a fanatic about it.&#x201d; I squirt antiseptic goo on my hands and rub it in, counting to ten. &#x201c;She asks me every morning&#x201d;&#x2014;I can hardly say it&#x2014;&#x201c;if I&#x2019;ve had a bowel movement!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s a tough one, Jer, but we do need to make sure all systems are go.&#x201d; He laughs at his joke.</p><p>&#x201c;And do I have to even mention that she forced me against my will to make angel ornaments with little puffy skirts?&#x201d;</p><p>Walt shakes his head. &#x201c;I know. But she&#x2019;s been here for us. She&#x2019;s really helped out.&#x201d;</p><p>Aunt Charity stayed with us for eight months when I was in and out of the hospital. I&#x2019;m totally grateful she did this.</p><p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s my only sister. What can I tell you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You can tell me she&#x2019;s not coming and I can go with you. I love her, okay? I just can&#x2019;t live with her right now.&#x201d; Or possibly ever.</p><p>Walt stands up. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s only for a couple of months. What could happen?&#x201d;</p><p>Phone again. I look up &#x201c;shortest wars in history.&#x201d; There&#x2019;s lots of material here. &#x201c;Whole wars have been fought in less than thirty days, Walt. Can you really take the chance?&#x201d;</p><p>Walt sips his coffee and looks at the map of the ancient world that I gave him for his birthday. It shows how wrong they were back in the 1500s. This was what Magellan had to deal with. Despite all that, he circumnavigated the globe before people knew it was a globe.</p><p>Is that vision or what?</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re telling me, Jer, you want to leave sixth grade at the end of March and come with me to Hillcrest, Ohio, where I will be working day and night?&#x201d;</p><p>I nod.</p><p>&#x201c;What would you be doing there?&#x201d; Walt persists.</p><p>&#x201c;Gaining brilliance?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re already too smart.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d go to school and I&#x2019;d help you. I could make dinner and&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>Walt shakes his head. His beard is getting some gray in it. People say it makes him look distinguished. He&#x2019;s wearing the T-shirt I got him for Father&#x2019;s Day&#x2014;it has a mug of coffee and, underneath that, the words GAME CHANGER.</p><p>It&#x2019;s kind of our story.</p><p>&#x201c;Jerwal,&#x201d; I say, &#x201c;come forward.&#x201d; Jerwal moves slowly toward us. &#x201c;Would you like to help the robots who are falling down?&#x201d;</p><p>Jerwal has no idea, but he likes hearing his name. It took us months to get the voice-activated part working. We had to shorten his name because he couldn&#x2019;t understand &#x201c;Jerwalthian,&#x201d; as in <i>The Jerwalthian has entered the atmosphere.</i></p><p>Walt sips more coffee. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry about how I live. I want you to have a stable environment.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t feel unstable, Walt.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You know what I mean. Not so much change.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t change.&#x201d;</p><p>He laughs. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re referring to my wardrobe?&#x201d;</p><p>Walt wears blue shirts with jeans or khakis most days.</p><p>I stretch out my arms like I&#x2019;m flying. &#x201c;So we just swoop into Hillcrest and make it happen.&#x201d;</p><p>Walt sips coffee, thinking.</p><p>I sip decaf. &#x201c;Jerwal, do you want to go play with the robots in Ohio?&#x201d; Jerwal beeps and moves his head and arms from side to side.</p><p>Walt points a finger of ultimate authority at me. &#x201c;For me to even consider it, Jer&#x2014;and I&#x2019;m not saying I am&#x2014;Dr. Feinberg needs to sign off on this one hundred percent. You understand that might not happen.&#x201d;</p><p>I clear my throat. &#x201c;I understand that in any contest, I will be tested, maybe to the boundaries of my ability. And when this happens, I will remember that I have overcome great difficulties already, and all that strength is in me.&#x201d;</p><p>Walt sniffs. &#x201c;Which coach said that?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I just created it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not bad.&#x201d;</p><p><i>When I&#x2019;m a coach I&#x2019;m going to tell my players to say that. </i>I write it down.</p><p>Walt studies my face.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m fine, Walt.&#x201d;</p><p>I say that a lot because it&#x2019;s true.</p><p>It&#x2019;s got to be true.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Chapter<br>3</p><p>NOT EVERYONE ON my transplant team could be here. We got this appointment fast.</p><p>Dr. Curchink is out sick and Dr. Meredith has an emergency with another patient, but Dr. Feinberg is here, and Hassan the transplant nurse, and Millard the tech guy, who keeps track of everything. Millard just gave me an echocardiogram to test the strength of my heart with sound waves. Hassan gets a blood sample from my left arm. I make a fist.</p><p>&#x201c;Your blood&#x2019;s still red,&#x201d; Hassan says.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been working hard to keep it red,&#x201d; I tell him.</p><p>Hassan smiles.</p><p>There&#x2019;s a plastic heart on the counter. So many people just take their hearts for granted. I did until third grade, when I caught a virus that slowly began attacking my heart muscle. I got a lot of colds that year. I wasn&#x2019;t eating much. I&#x2019;d run and have trouble breathing. We thought it was asthma at first. It wasn&#x2019;t even close to that.</p><p>Being a computer genius, Walt knew about viruses. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re going to find out what&#x2019;s going on with you,&#x201d; he told me. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s going to mean a lot of tests, and probably a few extra doctors.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want extra doctors.&#x201d;</p><p>You don&#x2019;t always get what you want.</p><p>Two years later, I had to have a heart transplant. I was ten. I don&#x2019;t recommend the experience, but I can promise you, it&#x2019;s so much better than dying.</p><p>I told Aunt Charity I wanted to keep my old heart in a jar at home to remember, but she started screaming about the intense grossness of that.</p><p>&#x201c;I made it to ten years of age with that heart,&#x201d; I told her. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s part of me.&#x201d;</p><p>She threw up her hands and said absolutely not.</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;...</p></p><h2>Selected Poems of Anne Sexton, Love Poems, Anne Sexton, a Biography</h2><p>With its simple, forceful imagery, Anne Sexton&#39;s poetry is not only remarkably powerful but also very accessible. The subjects she writes about--sex, mental breakdown, the search for spiritual meaning, the dark side of suburban life--speak to American readers today as eloquently as they did during her lifetime.</p><p>Anne Sexton (1928-1974), the author of ten collections of poems, received the Pulitzer Prize in 1967.Sexton claimed that poetry kept her alive through periods of suicidal self-hatred, and indeed her poetry started as therapy, a means suggested by her psychiatrist of documenting the unspeakable. This volume contains selections, many of them familiar, from her eight books. Despite professional success, she continued to suffer, but her work does more than document the pain that finally led to alcohol addiction and suicide. Labeled confessional, she preferred to be called a storyteller, often adopting a persona: "Like Oedipus I am losing my sight./Like Judas I have done my wrong." Much of the early poetry was workshop-influenced, but Sexton's music as well as her intensity and good ear ultimately come through.

Langer and her team of researchers at Harvard introduced a unique concept of mindfulness, adapted to contemporary life in the West. Langer's theory has been applied to a wide number of fields, including health, business, aging, social justice, and learning. There is now a new psychological assessment based on her work (called the Langer Mindfulness Scale). In her introduction to this 25th anniversary edition, Dr. Langer (now known as "the Mother of Mindfulness") outlines some of these exciting applications and suggests those still to come.<br><br></p><p><b>Ellen Langer, PhD,</b> Professor of Psychology at Harvard University, is the author <i>The Psychology of Control, Mindfulness, The Power of Mindful Learning, On Becoming an Artist</i>, and <i>Counterclockwise</i>. Her work has been translated into a dozen languages. She is the recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship and numerous awards, including the Award for Distinguished Contributions to Psychology in the Public Interest from the American Psychological Association.The mindless following of routine and other automatic behaviors lead to much error, pain and a predetermined course of life, contends Langer, Harvard professor of psychology, in this thought-provoking study in which she "translates" for lay readers the findings of her research, much of it among the elderly. With anecdotes and metaphors, she explains how the mindless--as opposed to the mindful--develop mindsets of categories, associations, habits of thought born of repetition in childhood and throughout schooling. To be mindful, she notes, stressing process over outcome, allows free rein to intuition and creativity, and opens us to new information and perspectives. Langer discusses the negative impact of mindsets on business and social relations, showing special concern for the elderly, who often suffer from learned helplessness and lack of options. Encouraging the application of mindfulness to health, the author affirms that placebos and alternative, mind-based therapies can help patients and addicts move from unhealthy to healthy contexts.

Missing from these accounts is a consideration of the technologies behind the creation of the globalized economy. What makes it possible for us to move billions of tons of raw materials and manufactured goods from continent to continent? Why are we able to fly almost anywhere on the planet within twenty-four hours? In <i>Prime Movers of Globalization</i>, Vaclav Smil offers a history of two key technical developments that have driven globalization: the high-compression non-sparking internal combustion engines invented by Rudolf Diesel in the 1890s and the gas turbines designed by Frank Whittle and Hans-Joachim Pabst von Ohain in the 1930s. The massive diesel engines that power cargo ships and the gas turbines that propel jet engines, Smil argues, are more important to the global economy than any corporate structure or international trade agreement. Smil compares the efficiency and scale of these two technologies to prime movers of the past, including the sail and the steam engine. The lengthy processes of development, commercialization, and diffusion that the diesel engine and the gas turbine went through, he argues, provide perfect examples of gradual technical advances that receive little attention but have resulted in epochal shifts in global affairs and the global economy.</p></p><p>Vaclav Smil is a Distinguished Professor Emeritus at the University of Manitoba. He is the author of more than thirty books, including <i>Harvesting the Biosphere: What We Have Taken from Nature</i> and, most recently, <i>Made in the USA: The Rise and Retreat of American Manufacturing,</i> both published by the MIT Press. In 2010 he was named by <i>Foreign Policy</i> as one of the Top 100 Global Thinkers. In 2013 Bill Gates wrote on his website that "there is no author whose books I look forward to more than Vaclav Smil."<p>"A stimulating book that connects the past with the future, from an outstanding writer who knows all about sustainability and the issues that make it such a challenge for us." John B. Heywood, Professor of Mechanical Engineering, Sun Jae Professor, Emeritus, MIT</p><br><br><p>"By scrutinizing common yet often-overlooked technologies, Smil offers a fresh and useful perspective on world economics." Mark Reutter Wilson Quarterly</p><br><br><p>"In Prime Movers, Smil's passion for the Cinderellas of civilization focuses on the diesel engines and gas turbines that power ocean vessels and wide-body jets. These engines have made ocean shipping and intercontinental air travel so cheap that they have changed the face of our planet. Marshall McLuhan's dreams of a Global Village have become true in unimagined ways. Being an engineer myself, I admire the way Smil portrays the human Cinderellas of the industrial world: the unsung engineers who made momentous advances in the reliability and efficiency of their machines. Smil's book makes me proud of my profession." Henk Tennekes, author of The Simple Science of Flight</p><br><br><p>"Mr. Smil's account of the engineering advances throughout the late 19th and 20th centuries -- advances that brought the world large marine diesels and gas turbines -- is first-rate history, both thorough and compelling." Nick Schulz The Wall Street Journal</p><br><br><p>"Smil masterfully traces the technological evolution and impact of diesel engines and gas turbines, and makes a convincing case for their role as prime movers of globalization -- even though these technologies escape public notice, buried in the bowels of ships, trucks, and power plants, and humming reliably under the wings of planes."

Donald Hall tells about life on a small farm where, as a boy, he spent summers with his grandparents. Gradually the boy grows to be a young man, sees his grandparents aging, the farm become marginal, and finally, the cows sold and the barn abandoned. But these are more than nostalgic memories, for in the measured and tender prose of each episode are signs of the end of things a childhood, perhaps a culture. In an Epilogue written for this edition, Donald Hall describes his return to the farm twenty-five years later, to live the rest of his life in the house of string.<br><br>We take pleasure in bringing back into print this classic account of boyhood summers in old New England, with the addition of an Epilogue and an album of family snapshots.</p><p>Donald Hall is the current United States Poet Laureate and the author of Lucy&#39;s Christmas, also from Godine.String Too Short to be Saved memorializes a time that is no more, but can live on forever in the warmth of the heart. --Joyce Bupp, Advisor<br><br>The best essays, for my money, to have been written about New England --The New York Times<br><br>The best essays, for my money, to have been written about New England --The New York Times</p><h2>The Girl&#39;s Like Spaghetti: Why, You Can&#39;t Manage without Apostrophes!</h2><p>A comanion to the best-seller <i>Eats, Shoots &amp; Leaves</i>, this is punctuation play at its finest!<br><br>Just as the use of commas was hilariously demystified in <i>Eats, Shoots &amp; Leaves: Why, Commas Really Do Make a Difference!</i>, now Lynne Truss and Bonnie Timmons put their talents together to do the same for apostrophes. Everyone needs to know where to put an apostrophe to make a word plural or possessive (Are those sticky things your brother's or your brothers?) and leaving one out of a contraction can give someone the completely wrong impression (Were here to help you).<p>Full of silly scenes that show how apostrophes make a difference, too, this is another picture book that will elicit bales of laughter and better punctuation from all who read it.<br><br></p></p><p>Lynne Truss is a writer and journalist who started out as a literary editor with a blue pencil and then got sidetracked. The author of three novels and numerous radio comedy dramas, she spent six years as the television critic of <i>The Times of London</i>, followed by four (rather peculiar) years as a sports columnist for the same newspaper. She won Columnist of the Year for her work for Women&#x2019;s Journal. Lynne Truss also hosted Cutting a Dash, a popular BBC Radio 4 series about punctuation. She now reviews books for the Sunday Times of London and is a familiar voice on BBC Radio 4. She lives in Brighton, England.<br>BONNIE TIMMONS is best known for inspiring and creating images for the television show <i>Caroline in the City</i> and illustrating numerous national ad campaigns.Bringing her proper-punctuation campaign to children for the second time, Truss follows up her best-selling 2006 picture book, Eats, Shoots, and Leaves: Why, Commas Really Do Matter! (which shares its title with Truss&#39; bestseller for adults) with this companion about apostrophes. Mishaps related to the flying comma (fancifully envisioned as a Good Punctuation Fairy . . . flitting above a page of words) are set forth in paired statements, with Timmons&#39; lighthearted cartoons driving home the shift in meaning precipitated by missing or misplaced apostrophes. The strain of coming up with clever, illustration-friendly examples occasionally shows, but many of the 13 scenarios successfully find the sweet spot between kid-pleasing goofiness and perfect clarity of purpose: with one scenario&#39;s play on the two meanings of behind, one referring to a horse&#39;s rear end, kids won&#39;t soon forget the crucial distinction between its and it&#39;s. Endnotes provide brief technical explanations. Hide your red pens: if Truss and Timmons keep this up, the grammar police may have its youngest recruits yet.

J.G.A. Pocock suggests that Machiavelli's prime emphasis was on the moment in which the republic confronts the problem of its own instability in time, and which he calls the "Machiavellian moment."</p><p>After examining this problem in the thought of Machiavelli, Guicciardini, and Giannotti, Pocock turns to the revival of republican thought in Puritan England and in Revolutionary and Federalist America. He argues that the American Revolution can be considered the last great act of civic humanism of the Renaissance. He relates the origins of modern historicism to the clash between civic, Christian, and commercial values in the thought of the eighteenth century.</p></p><p><p>"<i>The Machiavellian Moment</i> raised a thousand issues, settled two or three, and gave historians and philosophers a generation's work.

Ching on the second edition of <em>Interior Design Illustrated</em>, I was a bit intimidated, as I had used his books in my own architectural and interior design education and admired his beautiful illustrations. Now that we have again collaborated on the third edition, I am delighted to be part of this creative team, and I can see how my participation has made an important impact. <br><br> Frank is an author, illustrator, architect, and educator. After completing my BA, I studied architecture, but eventually received my masters degree in interior design. The combined knowledge base and point of view of an architect and interior designer is key to the success of <em>Interior Design Illustrated</em>. <br><br> <em>Interior Design Illustrated</em> is written and illustrated as an introduction to interior design. Unlike books that seek to teach only the elements of decorative design,<em> Interior Design Illustrated</em> starts with the premise that the design of the interior begins with an understanding of space and its expression in architecture. <br><br> A building&#x2019;s site, solar orientation, and the connection between outside and inside are all critical design elements that affect interior space. Its structure, enclosure system, and building services all support the spaces within the building. The character of interior spaces is shaped by the linear, planar, and volumetric elements of the building&#x2019;s form. <br><br> My decision to become an interior designer (rather than an architect) was based largely on my interest in how people use interior spaces and my love of color and texture, both of which are key to the design of interiors. However, my understanding of architecture and building systems (I am the author of Building Systems for Interior Designers, also published by Wiley) is a great advantage in my design of interior spaces. <br><br> As our understanding of sustainable design grows, we are increasingly working in existing buildings and reusing existing materials and furnishings. An appreciation for a building&#x2019;s architectural context aids in creating interior spaces that belong to the building and make the most of its assets. Creating interior spaces that delight the senses and support human needs is something every interior designer should know how to do. <br><br> Working with Frank Ching on this third edition of <em>Interior Design Illustrated</em> has been a pleasure and a learning experience. Frank&#x2019;s knowledge of architecture is encyclopedic, and his drawings are inspiring. I&#x2019;ve enjoyed representing the interior design viewpoint and filling in the details that make interior space come alive.<b>Ching's bestselling approach to interior design&#x2014;updated in this new, expanded edition</b> <p>In this elegant new edition, Francis D.K.

It wasn't the first time the Holy Father praised the book. This 1907 futuristic narrative has been hailed as the finest work of this unsung, but influential author and son of the Archbishop of Canterbury whose conversion to Catholicism rocked the Church of England in 1903. The compelling book includes a new introduction, a biography of Benson, and a theological reflection.<br><br>Popular young adult books such as <i>The Hunger Games</i> and <i>Divergent</i>, as well as literary classics such as Walker Percy's <i>Love in the Ruins</i> and Cormac McCarthy's <i>The Road</i>, have created a growing interest in dystopian novels. In one of the first such novels of the twentieth century, Robert Hugh Benson imagines a world where belief in God has been replaced by secular humanism. <i>Lord of the World</i> describes a world where Catholics are falling away and priests and bishops are defecting. Only a small remnant of the faithful remains. Julian Felsenburgh, a mysterious and compelling figure arises, promising peace in exchange for blind obedience. Those who resist are subjected to torture and execution. Soon the masses are in Felsenburgh's thrall and he becomes leader of the world. Into this melee steps the novel's protagonist, Fr. Percy Franklin. Dauntless and clear-sighted, Franklin is a bastion of stability as the Catholic Church in England disintegrates around him. Benson's harrowing plot soon brings these two charismatic men into a final apocalyptic conflict.<br><br>With an imagination to rival H. G. Wells and theological insight akin to G. K. Chesterton, Benson's astute novel has captured the attention of many today, including Popes Benedict and Francis. This new edition makes it easily available and features an insightful introduction by Rev. Mark Bosco, S.J., a brief biography of Benson by Martyn Sampson, and a theological reflection by Rev. Michael Murphy, S.J.</p><p><b>Robert Hugh Benson (1871-1914)</b> was an English Anglican priest who joined the Roman Catholic Church in 1903 and was ordained a Catholic priest in 1904. He was lauded in his own day as one of the leading figures in English literature and was the author of many novels and apologetic works.<br><br><b>Mark Bosco, S.J.</b>, is an associate professor at Loyola University Chicago, holding a joint position in the departments of English and theology, where he also directs the Joan and Bill Hank Center for the Catholic Intellectual Heritage.<br><br><b>Michael P.

Mark Bosco, S.J.</b><br><br>"Prophetic wisdom is often best expressed and appreciated through works of art. <i>Lord of the World</i> is just such a prophetic work of art. The book tells certain critical truths: that evil is at work in our time, that lies embed seeds of destruction in the promise of peace, and that Jesus Christ is victorious through the indignation and suffering of the Cross. <i>Lord of the World</i> is the right book for Christians in the modern world--and there may be no message more critical for our time." --<b>Most Rev. James D. Conley</b>, Bishop of Lincoln<br><br>"Benson's dystopic novel is more sinister than the simple hedonism of Huxley's dystopia and more subtle than the sheer brutality of Orwell's. I welcome Ave Maria Press's new edition of this classic and prophetic work." --<b>Joseph Pearce</b>, Editor of the <i>St. Austin Review</i><br><br>"By including both a fresh, context-clarifying introduction to Robert Hugh Benson and his dystopian tale and an invaluable meditation on the theology that drives it, Ave Maria Press gives us a relevant and readable edition of a harrowing 1907 novel that, in places, seems all too familiar and timely." --<b>Elizabeth Scalia</b>, Author of <i>Strange Gods</i></p><h2>The 5 Love Languages of Teenagers: The Secret to Loving Teens Effectively</h2><p><p><i><b>Over 600,000 copies sold! </b></i>Socially, mentally, and spiritually, teenagers face a variety of pressures and stresses each day.

But who were the skilled craftsmen who made these exquisite books? What precisely is parchment? How were medieval manuscripts designed and executed? What were the inks and pigments, and how were they applied? Examining the work of scribes, illuminators, and bookbinders, this lavishly illustrated account tells the story of manuscript production from the early Middle Ages through to the high Renaissance. Each stage of production is described in detail, from the preparation of the parchment, pens, paints, and inks to the writing of the scripts and the final decoration of the manuscript. Christopher de Hamel&#x2019;s engaging text is accompanied by a glossary of key technical terms relating to manuscripts and illumination, providing an invaluable introduction for anyone interested in studying medieval manuscripts today.</p><p><b>Christopher de Hamel </b>is a fellow of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, a fellow librarian of the Parker Library, and one of the world&#x2019;s leading experts on medieval manuscripts.<br> &nbsp;"Written in a lively and enjoyable style and including examples spanning the early Middle Ages through the Renaissance,&nbsp;<i>Making Medieval Manuscripts</i>&nbsp;is an informative account of the process of how medieval books were created."

Actually the record of a brief collecting expedition in the lonely Gulf of California, it will be science to the scientist, philosophy to the philosopher, and to the average man an adventure in living and thinking.<br><br> The teeming and wildly competitive world of the sand flats is seen in terms of history, politics, ethics, and sociology; a starfish is important, not only because it is a new variety, but because it is essential to the delicate balance of the whole region in which it is found. Steinbeck and Ricketts are the opposite of &#x201c;pure&#x201d; scientists: it is not only their work that fascinates them, but the complicated and enormously exciting implications of that work.<br><br> <i>Sea of Cortez</i> is a book to be read and remembered on two levels. It is a journey through a remote and beautiful corner of the world, a diary filled with the daily excitements and triumphs of skillful and energetic men. It is also an invitation to see the world anew from a fresh vantage point and perhaps with a broader and more understanding spirit.</p><p><b>John Steinbeck</b>, born in Salinas, California, in 1902, grew up in a fertile agricultural valley, about 25 miles from the Pacific Coast. Both the valley and the coast would serve as settings for some of his best fiction. In 1919 he went to Stanford University, where he intermittently enrolled in literature and writing courses until he left in 1925 without taking a degree. During the next five years he supported himself as a laborer and journalist in New York City, all the time working on his first novel,&nbsp;<i>Cup of Gold</i>&nbsp;(1929). After marriage and a move to Pacific Grove, he published two California books,&nbsp;<i>The Pastures of Heaven</i>&nbsp;(1932) and&nbsp;<i>To a God Unknown</i>&nbsp;(1933), and worked on short stories later collected in&nbsp;<i>The Long Valley&nbsp;</i>(1938). Popular success and financial security came only with&nbsp;<i>Tortilla Flat</i>&nbsp;(1935), stories about Monterey&#x2019;s paisanos. A ceaseless experimenter throughout his career, Steinbeck changed courses regularly. Three powerful novels of the late 1930s focused on the California laboring class:&nbsp;<i>In Dubious Battle&nbsp;</i>(1936),&nbsp;<i>Of Mice and Men</i>&nbsp;(1937), and the book considered by many his finest,&nbsp;<i>The Grapes of Wrath</i>&nbsp;(1939).&nbsp;<i>The Grapes of Wrath</i>&nbsp;won both the&nbsp;National Book Award&nbsp;and the&nbsp;Pulitzer Prize&nbsp;in 1939.Steinbeck received the&nbsp;Nobel Prize in Literature&nbsp;in 1962, and, in 1964, he was presented with the&nbsp;United States Medal of Freedom&nbsp;by President Lyndon B. Johnson. Steinbeck died in New York in 1968. Today, more than 30 years after his death, he remains one of America's greatest writers and cultural figures.<br><br><b>Edward F. Ricketts </b>was a marine biologist, ecologist, and philosopher. His most well-known work is <i>Between Pacific Tides, </i>which is a study of intertidal ecology. He was a major influence on the beloved American writer John Steinbeck, which led to their productive collaboration on the non-fiction work <i>Sea of Cortez. </i>Ricketts died in 1948.</p><h2>A Survey of Mathematics with Applications (9th Edition)</h2><p><p>In a Liberal Arts Math course, a common question students ask is, &#x201c;Why do I have to know this?&#x201d;&nbsp; <b>A Survey of Mathematics with Applications </b>continues to be a best-seller because it shows students <b>how</b> we use mathematics in our daily lives and <b>why</b> <b>this is important</b>.

This handsomely illustrated catalogue places Kent in her rightful position among the foremost figures of pop art, such as Andy Warhol, Ed Ruscha, and Roy Lichtenstein. Although Kent has been largely excluded from the academic and critical discourses surrounding 1960s American art, this publication reevaluates her importance and highlights how her work questioned and expanded the boundaries of the pop art movement.<br> &nbsp;<br> Four essays and nearly 90 catalogue entries pull together a variety of topics&#x2014;art history, religion, politics, linguistics, race, gender, mass media, and advertising&#x2014;that influenced Kent&#x2019;s life and work during the 1960s. Eminent pop scholars delve into the relationship between her art and that of her contemporaries, and explore how her art both responded to and advanced the changes in modern-day Catholicism stemming from Vatican II. More than 200 vibrant images showcase Kent&#x2019;s ingenious screenprints, which often combine handwritten text and commercial imagery. Offering an unparalleled, rigorous study of an artist who has been largely overlooked, this book is an important contribution to scholarship as well as a fascinating presentation of Kent and her work to a wider audience.</p><p>This vibrant publication positions Corita Kent in the pop art canon, pulling together interdisciplinary topics that influenced her life and work, such as religion, politics, linguistics, race, gender, and mass media.<br><b>Susan Dackerman</b> is consultative curator of prints at the Harvard Art Museums. <b>Julia Bryan-Wilson</b> is associate professor of art history at the University of California, Berkeley. <b>Richard Meyer</b> is the Robert and Ruth Halperin Professor of Art History at Stanford University. <b>Jennifer L.

In more than fifty smart and accessible short pieces from the past decade, Bierut engages with a fascinating and diverse array of subjects. Essays range across design history, practice, and process; urban design and architecture; design hoaxes; pop culture; Hydrox cookies, Peggy Noonan, baseball, The Sopranos; and an inside look at his experience creating the "forward" logo for Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign. Other writings celebrate such legendary figures as Jerry della Femina, Alan Fletcher, Charley Harper, and his own mentor, Massimo Vignelli. Bierut's longtime work in the trenches of graphic design informs everything he writes, lending depth, insight, and humor to this important and engrossing collection.</p><p>A partner at Pentagram Design&#39;s New York office, Michael Bierut has won numerous awards, and his work is in the permanent collections of MoMA; the Metropolitan Museum; the Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum; and the Library of Congress.

Bierut, a partner at Pentagram, writes with humor about how design shapes our world." <br> - Fast Company's Co.Design<br><br>"In Now You See It, Bierut displays his polyamorous curiosity and facility for explaining the world through a designer's lens. With his trademark wit and penchant for charming folksy anecdotes, he hops from an essay about the architecture of his childhood home, to several entries about his philosophy on fonts, detours to discussing dalliances with clients and concludes with reflections about his most-discussed work: the Hillary Clinton campaign logo. In each of the book's 53 bite-sized chapters, Bierut demonstrates how a designer can go into one rabbit hole and emerge smarter by taking the time to reflect about the visuals he encounters or produces." <br> - Quartz<br><br>"Bierut is the consummate corporate designer, and his collection of essays, Now You See It, brings you behind the curtain of professionalism to expose exactly how design is produced and functions in the real world. In other hands this might seem esoteric, but there is no more fluid or engaging writer, in any subject; reading Michael Bierut is like listening to Don Draper sell a campaign for Lucky Strike. Better still, in this book you can read Bierut riffing on the implications of Don Draper selling a campaign for Lucky Strike." <br> - Dallas Morning News</p><h2>Journey of Adulthood (8th Edition)</h2><p><p> <b>Applies Successful Aging to Adult Development</b> </p> <p> <b>&nbsp;</b> </p> <p> <i>Journey of Adulthood</i>, 8/e by Barbara R.

His "experiments with Truth" were far from complete at the time of his death, but he had developed a new technique for effecting social and political change through the constructive conduct of conflict: Gandhian satyagraha had become eminently more than "passive resistance" or "civil disobedience."</p><br><p> By relating what Gandhi said to what he did and by examining instances of satyagraha led by others, this book abstracts from the Indian experiments those essential elements that constitute the Gandhian technique. It explores, in terms familiar to the Western reader, its distinguishing characteristics and its far-reaching implications for social and political philosophy.</p></p><p>"<i>Conquest of Violence</i> has two merits: first, it gives us the clearest and most powerful statement to date of the central ideas in Gandhi's political thought; second, it forces us to consider these ideas not as a historical or cultural curiosity but as a challenge to the main body of Western political philosophy."<b>---W.

Seen in historical perspective it was not an especially big massacre: the revolt of the long-subjugated Sicilians might seem just another resistance movement. But the events of 1282 came at a crucial moment. Steven Runciman takes the Vespers as the climax of a great narrative sweep covering the whole of the Mediterranean in the thirteenth century. His sustained narrative power is displayed here with concentrated brilliance in the rise and fall of this fascinating episode. This is also an excellent guide to the historical background to Dante&#39;s Divine Comedy, forming almost a Who&#39;s Who of the political figures in it, and providing insight into their placement in Hell, Paradise or Purgatory.</p><p>On March 30, 1282, as the church bells of Palermo were sounding vespers, a crowd of Sicilians fell on a party of French soldiers, the enforcers of Angevin rule over the island. Within minutes the French lay dead. The Palermo revolt spread quickly across Sicily, opposed by Frankish lords and the Italian clergy, and supported by Sicilian commoners, Aragonese infiltrators, and Byzantine spies. Against a complicated multinational backdrop, the noted medieval historian Steven Runciman deftly portrays the tangled world of Mediterranean politics in the 13th century, the apex of the Middle Ages.On March 30, 1282, the Sicilian townsfolk of Palermo slaughtered the garrison and administration of their Angevin King. The massacre came at a climatic moment of thirteenth century Mediterranean history and its background is traced in this volume.</p><h2>Escape to Freedom (Secret of the Rose #3)</h2><p>For thousands of readers, Michael Phillips has expertly illustrated the grim realities and spiritual challenges of World War II and its aftermath in the first two volumes of The Secret of the Rose series. Imprisoned years before by the Nazis for his Jewish sympathies, Baron von Dortmann has now been rescued by his daughter Sabina. Events take a climatic turn in <i>Escape to Freedom</i> as the two--along with American ally Matthew McCallum--desperately elude their pursuers and seek a way out of Communist Germany. But paralleled with these years of trial is the strength of this family's courageous faith in God's steadfast care.</p><p><p>Separated by war, Matthew and Sabina long to be together. To find her, Matthew will have to cross the Iron Curtain into East Germany, without reasonable hope of returning to the free world. While searching the countryside for Sabina and her father, Matthew is pursued by the dangerous Gustav von Schmundt, section chief for the Stasi. Matthew finally finds the beautiful Sabina and presents her with a rose, a symbol of their deep and undying love. </p><p> Now Matthew, Sabina, and the baron must escape to West Germany before Gustav discovers their location. The borders are watched with hateful eyes, and the Berlin wall appears impenetrable. Only by relying on their strong faith in God will they find the courage to attempt an escape to freedom.</p>In 1970, while students at Humboldt State University, <b>Mike and Judy Phillips</b> began what would become the One Way BookShop as a small, informal source of Christian books and materials for their fellow students.

In this absorbing and eloquent book Martin Gilbert challenges the standard media portrayal and presents a fascinating account of hope, opportunity, fear, and terror that have characterized these two peoples through the 1,400 years of their intertwined history.</p><p>Harking back to the Biblical story of Ishmael and Isaac, Gilbert takes the reader from the origins of the fraught relationship&#x2014;the refusal of Medina&#x2019;s Jews to accept Mohammed as a prophet&#x2014;through the ages of the Crusader reconquest of the Holy Land and the great Muslim sultanates to the present day. He explores the impact of Zionism in the first half of the twentieth century, the clash of nationalisms during the Second World War, the mass expulsions and exodus of 800,000 Jews from Muslim lands following the birth of Israel, the Six-Day War and its aftermath, and the political sensitivities of the current Middle East.</p><p><i>In Ishmael&#x2019;s House</i> sheds light on a time of prosperity and opportunity for Jews in Muslim lands stretching from Morocco to Afghanistan, with many instances of Muslim openness, support, and courage. Drawing on Jewish, Christian, and Muslim sources, Gilbert uses archived material, poems, letters, memoirs, and personal testimony to uncover the human voice of this centuries-old conflict. Ultimately Gilbert&#x2019;s moving account of mutual tolerance between Muslims and Jews provides a perspective on current events and a template for the future.</p></p><p><b>Sir Martin Gilbert</b> is the author of more than eighty books, including the six-volume authorized biography of Winston Churchill.<b>1 BEFORE ISLAM.<br></b><br><i>&#x2018;A prince of Himyar&#x2019;<br></i><br><br>For more than a thousand years before Mohammed&#x2019;s birth in the year 570, Jews lived in what were to become &#x2013; with Mohammed and his followers&#x2019; conquests &#x2013; Muslim lands. These lands stretched from Spain to Afghanistan, and were inhabited by Arabs, Persians, Turks, Berbers and Jews. They included the great Jewish religious academies of Sura and Pumbeditha (now Faluja in present-day Iraq), two cities that were at the centre of Jewish religious thought and ethics, and where the Babylonian Talmud was compiled more than two thousand years ago.<br>&nbsp;<br>Across this wide swathe of land, Jewish graves of great antiquity have been found. In the Tunisian city of Carthage, Jewish gravestone inscriptions date from 813 BCE (Before the Common Era). Yemeni tradition also holds that a group of prosperous Jews arrived in Yemen from Jerusalem as early as 629 BCE, after they heard the Prophet Jeremiah predict the destruction of the Jewish Temple. It is possible that the migration of Jews to Yemen began even earlier. When Yemen was ruled by the Queen of Sheba in 900 BCE, the trading and naval networks established by King Solomon brought Jews from Judaea to Yemen, a journey of 1,400 miles.<br>&nbsp;<br>Jerusalem, which came under Muslim rule for the first time in the year 638 CE, had formed a focal point of Jewish life for more than a millennium before the dawn of Islam. It had been the Jewish capital for more than six hundred years when it was conquered by the Babylonians in 587 BCE. The city also became the centre of a Jewish kingdom, ruled by Jewish kings, for seventy-eight years from 141 BCE to 63 BCE. Some of Jerusalem&#x2019;s rulers at other times, including the Romans and the Seleucid Greek Antiochus IV, turned against the Jews; others, including Alexander the Great and the Ptolemys of Egypt, allowed Jewish life to flourish.<br>&nbsp;<br>When the King of Persia, Cyrus the Great, defeated the Babylonians in 539 BCE, he liberated the Jews of Jerusalem. Some of the &#x2018;freed slaves&#x2019; &#x2013; who were no longer forced to worship idols &#x2013; began to rebuild their Temple, which had been destroyed forty-two years after the Prophet Jeremiah&#x2019;s prediction. Others went eastward to settle in Persia. Among their descendants a hundred years later were Esther and her cousin Mordecai, who forestalled an attempt by the Grand Vizier, Haman, to exterminate the entire Persian Jewish community.1<br>&nbsp;<br>Similar migrations and resettlements occurred elsewhere, sending Jews to far-flung corners of those lands later conquered by Islam in the Seventh and Eighth Centuries. The Babylonian King Nabonidus brought Jewish exiles to Tayma, an oasis in modern-day Saudi Arabia, when he established his capital there a thousand years before the rise of Islam.2 Tomb inscriptions also confirm that Jews lived in the Arabian towns of al-Hijr (Mada&#x2019;in Salih) and al-Ula five hundred years before Mohammed&#x2019;s birth.3 Likewise, in 312 BCE, the ruler of Egypt, Ptolemy Lagos, settled Jews in Cyrenaica &#x2013; present-day Libya &#x2013; as a way of strengthening his kingdom. Inscriptions in Benghazi and in other places across Libya show a wealthy, well-established, well-organised Jewish community living there in 146 BCE, at the start of Roman rule.4<br>&nbsp;<br>In those parts of the Roman Empire that were later conquered by Arabs and brought under Muslim rule, including the whole of North Africa, as well as Syria and Egypt, Jews lived and often flourished as farmers and traders. But living as part of the <i>Pax Romana </i>did not preclude further migrations for the Jews. In 25 BCE, King Herod was installed by the Romans as the ruler of the province of Judaea, which had its capital in Jerusalem. Herod, the son of a convert to Judaism, sent a Jewish military force to establish Roman control in Yemen. The expedition was a failure, but some of the soldiers remained and settled there to form the southernmost Jewish community of Roman times.<br>&nbsp;<br>A notable Jew who also travelled out of Judaea was Rabbi Akiva,the Jewish scholar and leader, who journeyed with others from Jerusalem to Carthage in order to teach there among the many renowned rabbis. The Jews did not always migrate from Judaea by choice in Roman times. When the Romans destroyed Jerusalem and the Temple in 70 CE &#x2013; following a failed Jewish revolt &#x2013; they expelled an estimated thirty thousand Jews from their ancient homeland. These deportees were sent to North Africa.<br>&nbsp;<br>The Roman-Jewish historian Josephus recounted that a similar fate was handed to Jews held captive after Bar Kokhba&#x2019;s failed Jewish revolt in 136 CE. According to Josephus, twelve boatloads of Jewish captives were deported from Judaea to Cyrenaica, where half a million Jews were already living at that time. He wrote that most of the Cyrenaican Jews lived in farming villages, while those living by the sea were often sailors, and many others were potters, stonemasons, weavers and merchants.5 The new arrivals in Cyrenaica were among as many as a million Jews who were forced to leave Judaea, renamed &nbsp;&#x2018;Syria Palaestina&#x2019; by the Romans in 132 CE &#x2013; its coins engraved with the words &#x2018;Judaea Capta.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>In 115 CE the Jews of Cyrenaica had revolted against the Romans, with similar results. Josephus recalled that, after the revolt was crushed, the Roman Governor Catullus murdered &#x2018;all the wealthier Jews to the number of three thousand, and confiscated all their possessions.&#x2019;6 It was in response to this violent repression that many Cyrenaican Jews fled deep into the Sahara and lived there among the Berber tribes, some of whom they later converted to Judaism. Ironically, it was a Cyrenaican Jew, Mark &#x2013; the St. Mark of the Gospels &#x2013; who converted to Christianity and founded the Coptic Church, introducing Christianity to Africa.<br>&nbsp;<br>Among the many new homelands for Jews who migrated in this period, Persia, known today as Iran, was one of the most significant. In 226 CE, King Shahpur I founded the Sasanian Empire there. Jews are reported to have held high-ranking positions in the empire&#x2019;s society and government. During the four hundred years of Sasanian rule, Persian Jews were among those who wrote the Babylonian Talmud, a crucial repository of Jewish theology and law to this day.7<br>&nbsp;<br>Displaced Jews also enlarged the Yemeni Jewish community, particularly after Bar Kokhba&#x2019;s revolt prompted the first significant Jewish migration from Judaea to Yemen. Jews were consummate traders, and Yemen was then famous throughout the Graeco-Roman world for its prosperous trade, especially in spices.8 Dominating the southern end of the Red Sea, Yemen was a focal point for both seaborne trade and the overland routes from southwestern Arabia. The first written evidence of a Jewish presence in Yemen dates to the Third Century CE. The Jews&#x2019; proficiency in trade had led them to the northern extremity of the Red Sea as well &#x2013; to the twin islands of Tiran and Sanapir in the Straits of Tiran, which were for many years Jewish islands.9<br>&nbsp;<br>In the Fifth Century, Yemen adopted Judaism as its religion. King Ab Karib As&#x2018;ad, the ruler of the Himyarite kingdom, introduced the change after converting to Judaism himself under the influence of Jews at his court. Many south Arabian converts to Judaism followed; Jewish rule in Yemen lasted almost a hundred years.<br>&nbsp;<br>The most famous Hebrew King of Yemen, Yusuf Asar, came to the throne in 515 CE. He was a religious man known to the Arabs as Dhu Nuwas (&#x2018;the man with the hanging locks&#x2019;), and his rule in Yemen has been described as heralding a &#x2018;Golden Age&#x2019; for local Jews and Arabs alike.10 But his reign was not lacking in outward violence and conflict. Citing the persecution of Jews in Christian Byzantium, Dhu Nuwas attacked the Christian stronghold of Najran and massacred all those who would not renounce Christianity. Then, only ten years after ascending to the throne, Dhu Nuwas was defeated by Christians from Ethiopia, allies of the Christian empire of Byzantium. Yemen, along with the Jewish islands of Tiran and Sanapir, fell under Byzantine rule.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Within the Roman Empire in the years before Islam, hundreds of thousands of Jews made their way, by ship and overland, to new homes as far west as Spain and North Africa, as far north as the Swiss Alps, as far east as the shores of the Black and Caspian Seas, and as far south as Yemen. In their new homelands &#x2013; known as the Diaspora or <i>galut </i>(exile) &#x2013; these Jews built up communities where, during the three hundred years before the spread of Christianity, and the five hundred years before the rise of Islam, they maintained their faith, customs and traditions. Although they adopted local languages in their daily life and work, they preserved Hebrew as the language of literacy and prayer. They settled across a vast geographic region, and yet they retained a strong bond of connection through their religion: the belief in one God, the laws and ethical code of the Torah, and the devotion to prayer, self-help, family and community.<br>&nbsp;<br>Jews also maintained strong ties to their ancient Judaean homeland. Yemeni Jews made great efforts to return to Judaea when burying their dead, sometimes embarking on a journey across the deserts of Arabia that would take at least sixty days by caravan. In the Jewish cemetery at Beth Shearim, in the Jezreel Valley, four burial chambers were discovered in 1936 with wooden, stone and lead sarcophagi that had been brought there from Yemen. The cemetery had been in use until the late Fourth Century. On one sarcophagus was an inscription in the southern Arabian alphabet that read: &#x2018;A prince of Himyar.&#x2019;11<br>&nbsp;<br>Starting in 325, Judaea &#x2013; as part of &#x2018;Palaestina&#x2019; &#x2013; was ruled for nearly three hundred years by the Christian emperors of Byzantium, whose capital was eight hundred miles away in Constantinople. The Jews of Jerusalem decided to join forces with the Persians in 614 to besiege Jerusalem and free it from Christian rule. When the Persian Army defeated the Byzantines they handed Jerusalem back to the Jews. It remained under Jewish rule for fifteen years. But in 629, Jerusalem was retaken by the Byzantine Emperor Heraclius, an Armenian Christian, and again the Jews were banished.<br>&nbsp;<br>During his nine-year rule over Jerusalem, Heraclius carried out a campaign of vengeance against the Jews. He decreed the forcible conversion of Jews to Christianity in all the European and Asian territories of the Byzantine Empire, and in 632 &#x2013; the year of Mohammed&#x2019;s death &#x2013; he extended that conversion decree to North Africa. It was not until Arab Muslims conquered Jerusalem in 638 that the Jews were allowed to return to the city and to practise their faith. At that time, Heraclius was about to begin the Jews&#x2019; forcible conversion in North Africa. But as the historian H.Z. Hirschberg writes, it was precisely at this moment that &#x2018;Arab tribes sallied forth from the desert with the slogan &#x201c;There is no God but Allah, and Mohammed is the Messenger of Allah,&#x201d; which welded them into one people and a militant religious community.&#x2019; This formidable military force &#x2018;swept Heraclius and his army from most of the areas in Asia, invaded Egypt and set their eyes on the fertile places of North Africa and Spain.&#x2019;12<br>&nbsp;<br>Help was at hand for the Jews persecuted in Christian lands.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>1 Esther&#x2019;s tomb in the Iranian city of Hamdan is surrounded by Jewish graves, as Jews considered the area around her tomb to be holier than the main Jewish cemetery. The tomb&#x2019;s majestic brick dome dates back to 1602. Houman Sarshar (editor), <i>Esther&#x2019;s Children: A Portrait of Iranian Jews</i>, pages xviii, 23 and 25.<br>2 The historian Charles C. Torrey believes that even before Nabonidus, who ruled from 555 to 539 BCE, Jewish traders had settled in the oasis towns of the Hedjaz, including the city of Yathrib (Medina). Charles C. Torrey, <i>The Jewish Foundation of Islam</i>, pages 10 and 17-18.<br>3 An inscription on a sundial at al-Hijr mentions a Jew, Menasha bar Nathan Shelam, who may have been the astronomer who owned the sundial or the craftsman who carved it. The Roman general Aelius Gallus also found Jews living at al-Hijr on his way to conquer Yemen in 25 BCE. The Babylonian Talmud (late Fourth, early Fifth Century) mentions a certain Anan ben Hiyya of Hijra (Tractate Yevamot: 116a), who appears with regard to a discussion of a bill of divorce found in the Babylonian city of Sura.<br>4 Maurice M.

It's also a great resource for all of those self-publishing cookbook authors out there. Authors Barbara Gibbs Ostmann and Jane L. Baker, both experienced newspaper foodies, culled information from a fistful of sources (Williams Sonoma and <i>Food &amp; Wine</i> among them) to create their guide. The results should be a relief both to food writers and to the cooks who rely on their recipes. <i>The Recipe Writer's Handbook</i> addresses recipe-writing style, spellings of common (and not so common) ingredients, definitions of cooking terminology, and nutritional analysis. It stresses, above all else, accuracy, consistency, and clarity; it admonishes the recipe developer to assume nothing about what the readers know (apparently, one editor was asked by a reader how far to drop drop cookies; another got a call from a woman who wanted to know whether her new oven was preheated). Most interesting is the final section, in which food professionals wax philosophical on what makes a good recipe good.The Recipe Writer&#x2019;s Handbook Every recipe you write has the power to make or break a meal&#x2014;and a cook&#x2019;s reputation! That&#x2019;s why it is up to you to combine accuracy, consistency, and your personal style in recipes that are easy to understand and use.

Not with The Recipe Writer&#x2019;s Handbook by your side. Whether you&#x2019;re working in the kitchen or at the computer, this comprehensive handbook provides definitive guidance on how to write concise and complete recipes without sacrificing your creativity or your personal touch. The Haudbook teaches you how to "think" your way through a recipe to make important decisions and troubleshoot potential problems concerning format and syntax, spelling, cooking terminology, weights and measurements, recipe testing, presentation of the final recipe, and many other areas. In the foreword, Antonia Allegra, president of the International Association of Culinary Professionals, ponders the soul of a well-written recipe.

Analyzing cultural practices such as anthropology, travel writing, collecting, and museum displays of tribal art, James Clifford shows authoritative accounts of other ways of life to be contingent fictions, now actively contested in post-colonial contexts. His critique raises questions of global significance: Who has the authority to speak for any group&#x2019;s identity and authenticity? What are the essential elements and boundaries of a culture? How do self and &#x201c;the other&#x201d; clash in the encounters of ethnography, travel, and modern interethnic relations?</p><p>In chapters devoted to the history of anthropology, Clifford discusses the work of Malinowski, Mead, Griaule, L�vi-Strauss, Turner, Geertz, and other influential scholars. He also explores the affinity of ethnography with avant-garde art and writing, recovering a subversive, self-reflexive cultural criticism. The surrealists&#x2019; encounters with Paris or New York, the work of Georges Bataille and Michel Leiris in the Coll�ge de Sociologie, and the hybrid constructions of recent tribal artists offer provocative ethnographic examples that challenge familiar notions of difference and identity. In an emerging global modernity, the exotic is unexpectedly nearby, the familiar strangely distanced.</p></p><p>The Predicament Of Culture is a critical ethnography of the West in its changing relations with other societies.

Michael Baxandall begins by developing a scheme for the explanation of concrete historical objects in general, taking as an example how we think about a complex artifact such as a bridge, the Forth Bridge in Scotland. He then shows how this scheme is adapted to the explanation -- or inferential criticism -- of pictures. Analyzing in detail Picasso&#39;s Portrait of Kahnweiler, Chardin&#39;s A Lady Taking Tea, and Piero della Francesca&#39;s Baptism of Christ, Baxandall discusses the painter&#39;s goal, his sense of what is wanted from him and what he wants, the market in which he works, the culture from which he draws resources, his relation to other painters, and the use he makes of philosophical or scientific ideas. Baxandall then reflects on how far we can understand the mind of an artist living in a different culture and to what extent we can test and evaluate a historical interpretation of a picture. Braxandall does not claim that the method of inferential criticism is the only way to think about pictures. But if we accept that behind a superior picture there is a superior organization -- perceptual, emotional, and constructive -- it seems evident that attempting to discover the artist&#39;s intentions will sharpen our legitimate satisfaction in the picture itself.</p><p></p><h2>South Side</h2><p><p><b>**One of Buzzfeed's </b><b>18 Best Nonfiction Books Of 2016**</b></p><p>A lyrical, intelligent, authentic, and necessary look at the intersection of race and class in Chicago, a Great American City</p><p>In this intelligent and highly important narrative, Chicago-native Natalie Moore shines a light on contemporary segregation in the city's South Side; with a memoirist's eye, she showcases the lives of these communities through the stories of people who reside there. <i>The South Side </i>shows the impact of Chicago's historic segregation - and the ongoing policies that keep the system intact.</p></p><p>NATALIE Y.

Born out of wedlock in 1813, he went to work at age thirteen to help support his family in Charleston, South Carolina. He was a nobody. Yet by the 1840s, he rose to become one of the most acclaimed people of the age&#x2014;known as a wilderness explorer, bestselling writer, gallant army officer, and latter-day conquistador, who in 1846 began the United States&#x2019; takeover of California from Mexico. He was a celebrity who personified the country&#x2019;s westward expansion. Mountains, towns, ships, and streets were named after him. <br><br> How did he climb so far? A vital factor was his wife, Jessie Benton Fr�mont, the daughter of a United States senator. Jessie wanted to play roles in politics and exploration, which were then reserved for men. Frustrated, she threw her skill and passion into promoting her husband. Ordered by the US Army to map the Oregon Trail, John traveled thousands of miles on horseback, indifferent to his safety and that of the other members of his expeditions. When he returned home, Jessie helped him to shape dramatic reports of his adventures, which were reprinted in newspapers and bound as popular books. Jessie became his political adviser, and a power player in her own right. In 1856, the famous couple strategized as John became the first-ever presidential nominee of the newly established Republican Party. The party had been founded in opposition to slavery, and though both Fr�monts were Southerners they became symbols of the cause.&nbsp;<br><br> With rare detail and in consummate style, Steve Inskeep tells the story of a couple whose joint ambitions and talents intertwined with those of the nascent United States itself. Americans linked the Fr�monts with not one but three great social movements of the time&#x2014;westward settlement, women&#x2019;s rights, and opposition to slavery. Theirs is a surprisingly modern story of ambition and fame; they lived in a time of globalization, technological disruption, and divisive politics that foreshadowed our own. The Fr�monts&#x2019; adventures amount to nothing less than a tour of the early American soul.</p><p><b>Steve Inskeep </b>is a cohost of NPR&#x2019;s<i>&nbsp;Morning Edition</i>, the most widely heard radio program in the United States, and of NPR&#x2019;s <i>Up First</i>,<i> </i>one of the nation&#x2019;s most popular podcasts.

Wilder's <em>The Matchmaker</em> was adapted as the musical <em>Hello, Dolly!</em>.

The book was an immediate success. The central character, Anne Shirley, an orphaned girl, made Montgomery famous in her lifetime and gave her an international following. The first novel was followed by a series of sequels with Anne as the central character. Montgomery went on to publish 20 novels as well as 530 short stories, 500 poems, and 30 essays. Most of the novels were set in Prince Edward Island, and locations within Canada's smallest province became a literary landmark and popular tourist site&#x2014;namely Green Gables farm, the genesis of Prince Edward Island National Park. She was made an officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1935.</p><h2>Shadows on the Rock</h2><p>Set in seventeenth-century Canada, an evocation of North American origins highlights the men and women who struggled to adapt to the new world even as they clung to the one they left behind.

This new edition includes a fond, funny and brilliant introduction by the poet and translator Michael Hofmann. Here is Berryman's masterpiece, one of those books of American poetry that, like certain mountains, has its own weather. Berryman found his form in these songs.

Authors Bruce Rosenblum and Fred Kuttner explain all of this in non-technical terms with help from some fanciful stories and anecdotes about the theory's developers. They present the quantum mystery honestly, with an emphasis on what is and what is not speculation. <em>Quantum Enigma</em>'s description of the experimental quantum facts, and the quantum theory explaining them, is undisputed. Interpreting what it all means, however, is controversial. Every interpretation of quantum physics encounters consciousness. Rosenblum and Kuttner therefore turn to exploring consciousness itself--and encounter quantum physics. Free will and anthropic principles become crucial issues, and the connection of consciousness with the cosmos suggested by some leading quantum cosmologists is mind-blowing. Readers are brought to a boundary where the particular expertise of physicists is no longer a sure guide. They will find, instead, the facts and hints provided by quantum mechanics and the ability to speculate for themselves.<br><br> "A remarkable and readable presentation of the basic mysteries of science, our universe, and human life.

R. R. Tolkien worked at creating plausibly realistic languages to be used by the creatures and characters in his novels. Like his other languages, Sindarin was a new invention, not based on any existing or artificial language. By the time of his death, he had established fairly complete descriptions of two languages, the "elvish" tongues Quenya and Sindarin. He was able to compose poetic and prose texts in both, and he also constructed a lengthy sequence of changes for both from an ancestral "proto-language," comparable to the development of historical languages and capable of analysis with the techniques of historical linguistics.<br><br>In <i>A Gateway to Sindarin</i>, David Salo has created a volume that is a serious look at an entertaining topic. Salo covers the grammar, morphology, and history of the language. Supplemental material includes a vocabulary, Sindarin names, a glossary of terms, and an annotated list of works relevant to Sindarin. What emerges is an homage to Tolkien's scholarly philological efforts.</p></p><p><p><b>David Salo</b> is a doctoral candidate in linguistics at the University of Wisconsin.

The Argument Builder is the ideal companion to The Art of Argument for students in eighth grade and up, as well as many curious adults! The Argument Builder trains students to build their own sound and persuasive arguments. Written in a conversational, humorous, and easy to understand style, the text is a blend of logic and rhetoric-students first study the logical structure of good arguments and then study how to use several lines of argument (a.k.a., the common topics, first invented by Aristotle) including examples, analogy, comparison, testimony, and statistics, and layer them together into a strong whole. The text comes in a workbook format with many everyday examples, funny illustrations, and plenty of exercises to ensure students learn to become skilled argument makers!</p><p></p><h2>Worlds Together, Worlds Apart</h2><p><p><strong>Global connections and comparisons, now more accessible and interactive<br></strong></p> The most globally integrated book in its field, Worlds Together, Worlds Apart is unmatched in helping students draw connections and comparisons across time and place.

Final contributions consider Nietzsche&#39;s influence on the twentieth century in Europe, the U.S. and Asia.The significance of Friedrich Nietzsche for twentieth-century culture is now no longer a matter of dispute. He was quite simply one of the most influential of modern thinkers. His attempts to unmask the root motives underlying traditional Western philosophy, morality, and religion have deeply affected subsequent generations of philosophers, theologians, psychologists, poets, novelists, and playwrights. Nietzsche thought through the consequences of the triumph of Enlightenment secularism and in so doing laid the foundations for the philosophical agenda of the twentieth century, the &#39;post-Nietzschean age.&#39;</p>
